> 👩‍🏫 “This haiku evokes a sense of divine serenity through the image of a hermit's son. The first line, 'Like heaven itself,' immediately sets a tone of purity and transcendence, suggesting that the subject of the poem is being compared to the ethereal beauty of the heavens. The second line, 'In glory's light arrayed,' builds upon this by implying that the hermit's son is enveloped in a light that is both magnificent and perhaps spiritual in nature. The use of the word 'arrayed' connotes a deliberate and careful adornment, as if the light is a garment chosen for its splendor. The final line, 'This hermit's son,' brings a human element to the poem, contrasting the vastness of heaven with the simplicity of a solitary figure. The hermit's son, likely raised in seclusion and contemplation, becomes a symbol of purity and a vessel for the divine light. The haiku thus captures a moment of profound connection between the earthly and the heavenly, suggesting that even in solitude, one can be touched by the sublime.”

## Description

GutenKu is a creative, literature-inspired project that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP), Markov Chain algorithms, Vue.js, and MongoDB to generate haiku poetry. The project scrapes selected text data from Project Gutenberg, a vast online library of free eBooks. This data is then processed to extract quotes, generate unique haiku, and offer sentiment analysis of the created poems. Furthermore, GutenKu employs OpenAI to improve selection and provide descriptions for each haiku. Ultimately, the application generates images of the haikus.

## How it works

GutenKu operates by leveraging Python to scrape textual data from a curated whitelist of eBooks on Project Gutenberg. This gathered data is then processed through a Markov Chain, a probabilistic model that transitions from one state to another based on defined rules. The model is employed to identify and sequence sentences with the highest transition probabilities.

Once sentences are generated, Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques come into play. These techniques disassemble sentences into words, conduct sentiment analysis, and enforce the traditional 5-7-5 syllable structure of a haiku. The syllable counting is facilitated by the syllable library.

The processed chapters are stored in a MongoDB database, along with the generated haikus, improving the application's performance with a cache system based on TTL principles. GutenKu also incorporates OpenAI api to enhance haiku selection and to generate descriptive narratives for each haiku. In the final stage, the application creates ready-to-post images of the haikus.

The user-facing side of the application is powered by Vue.js 3, providing an interactive interface that not only displays the generated haikus. It also offers an advanced mode for more personalized and unique results.

## API Endpoint

GutenKu provides a GraphQL API for interacting with the service. The server is built using Apollo Server, a community-driven, open-source GraphQL server that works with any GraphQL schema.

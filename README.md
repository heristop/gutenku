> _"This haiku presents a quiet, unsettling scene shaped by absence and uncertainty. The opening line, “no light had been seen,” establishes both literal darkness and a figurative lack of clarity—something (or someone) has been hidden from view, and the speaker is left without reassurance. The second line, “wrapt only in a green rug,” narrows the focus to a single vivid image: a body-like form bundled in something ordinary and domestic. The choice of “green” can suggest life, nature, or healing, yet here it feels ambiguous—comforting like a blanket, but also concealing like a shroud. The final line, “whether sick or sound,” lands as a hushed question, revealing the speaker’s doubt and concern. The poem’s power lies in what it withholds: we are given no explanation, only the tension between care and fear, rest and danger. In three lines, it captures how darkness breeds anxiety, and how a simple covering can become a symbol of vulnerability and unknown fate."_

## About

GutenKu transforms classic literature from Project Gutenberg into haiku poetry using NLP, Markov Chain algorithms, and OpenAI for selection and narrative generation.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Selection** — OpenAI refines haiku choices and generates poetic narratives
- **Self-Learning** — Neural network discovers quality patterns by observing which haiku survive evolution
- **Daily Puzzle Game** — Guess the source book from haiku clues
- **Shareable Cards** — Generate beautiful image cards for social media
- **Sentiment Analysis** — Score and filter haikus by emotional tone

## How It Works

1. **Scrape** — Collect texts from a curated whitelist of eBooks on Project Gutenberg
2. **Process** — Apply Markov Chain to sequence sentences with highest transition probabilities
3. **Structure** — Enforce traditional 5-7-5 syllable structure via NLP
4. **Evolve** — Genetic algorithm optimizes haiku through natural selection; a neural network learns which patterns survive
5. **Select** — Choose candidates and generate narratives with OpenAI
6. **Render** — Create shareable image cards

## Quick Start

> _"This haiku creates a mood of mystery, separation, and quiet loneliness. The opening question, "where did it come from," suggests uncertainty about an origin, as though the speaker is trying to understand a person, feeling, or presence that has appeared unexpectedly. The second line, "Has he remained in London," shifts the focus to a specific place, giving the poem a sense of distance and urban isolation. London here may symbolize a crowded city where someone can still feel alone or hidden. The final phrase, "apart from the hound," is especially striking because it implies both physical and emotional separation. It may suggest that the person is isolated except for a dog, or that they are living in a way that sets them apart from others. Overall, the haiku uses brief, fragmented language to evoke curiosity, loneliness, and the feeling of being detached from one’s surroundings."_

## About

GutenKu transforms classic literature from Project Gutenberg into haiku poetry using NLP, Markov Chain algorithms, and OpenAI for selection and narrative generation.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Selection** — OpenAI refines haiku choices and generates poetic narratives
- **Self-Learning** — Neural network discovers quality patterns by observing which haiku survive evolution
- **Daily Puzzle Game** — Guess the source book from haiku clues
- **Shareable Cards** — Generate beautiful image cards for social media
- **Sentiment Analysis** — Score and filter haikus by emotional tone

## How It Works

1. **Scrape** — Collect texts from a curated whitelist of eBooks on Project Gutenberg
2. **Process** — Apply Markov Chain to sequence sentences with highest transition probabilities
3. **Structure** — Enforce traditional 5-7-5 syllable structure via NLP
4. **Evolve** — Genetic algorithm optimizes haiku through natural selection; a neural network learns which patterns survive
5. **Select** — Choose candidates and generate narratives with OpenAI
6. **Render** — Create shareable image cards

## Quick Start

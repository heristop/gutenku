> üë©‚Äçüè´ ‚ÄúThis haiku seems to reflect on the enduring happiness of a character named Nebridius. The first line, 'Whatever that be,' suggests a sense of acceptance or resignation to the circumstances or the essence of existence. It implies that regardless of what life is or what it brings, there is a constant element. 'There lives my Nebridius' introduces a personal connection to Nebridius, indicating that this character holds a significant place in the speaker's life or thoughts. Nebridius could be a person, a pet, or even a personification of an idea or emotion that the speaker cherishes. The final line, 'Endlessly happy,' conveys a state of perpetual joy, suggesting that Nebridius exists in a state of bliss that is unaffected by the changing nature of 'whatever that be.' The haiku captures a snapshot of contentment and peace, perhaps highlighting the idea that true happiness is internal and not dependent on external factors.‚Äù

## Description

GutenKu is a creative, literature-inspired project that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP), Markov Chain algorithms, Vue.js, and MongoDB to generate haiku poetry. The project scrapes selected text data from Project Gutenberg, a vast online library of free eBooks. This data is then processed to extract quotes, generate unique haiku, and offer sentiment analysis of the created poems. Furthermore, GutenKu employs OpenAI to improve selection and provide descriptions for each haiku. Ultimately, the application generates images of the haikus.

## How it works

GutenKu operates by leveraging Python to scrape textual data from a curated whitelist of eBooks on Project Gutenberg. This gathered data is then processed through a Markov Chain, a probabilistic model that transitions from one state to another based on defined rules. The model is employed to identify and sequence sentences with the highest transition probabilities.

Once sentences are generated, Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques come into play. These techniques disassemble sentences into words, conduct sentiment analysis, and enforce the traditional 5-7-5 syllable structure of a haiku. The syllable counting is facilitated by the syllable library.

The processed chapters are stored in a MongoDB database, along with the generated haikus, improving the application's performance with a cache system based on TTL principles. GutenKu also incorporates OpenAI api to enhance haiku selection and to generate descriptive narratives for each haiku. In the final stage, the application creates ready-to-post images of the haikus.

The user-facing side of the application is powered by Vue.js 3, providing an interactive interface that not only displays the generated haikus. It also offers an advanced mode for more personalized and unique results.

## API Endpoint

GutenKu provides a GraphQL API for interacting with the service. The server is built using Apollo Server, a community-driven, open-source GraphQL server that works with any GraphQL schema.

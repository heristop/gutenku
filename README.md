> üë©‚Äçüè´ ‚ÄúThis haiku beautifully captures the interplay between time and emotion. The first line, 'Time hung on our hands,' evokes a sense of stillness or a moment suspended, suggesting that time is both a tangible presence and an intangible concept. This could imply a pause in life where the usual rush of time feels different, perhaps during a moment of reflection or deep connection. The second line, 'With much wonder in my heart,' introduces an emotional aspect‚Äîan inner sense of awe or curiosity that accompanies this stillness. The combination of these lines suggests that in moments where time feels slowed, our capacity for wonder expands. The final line, 'And to my wonder,' reinforces this theme of surprise and delight, leaving the reader with a sense of unresolved potential, as if the speaker is still in the process of discovering what this wonder will lead to. Overall, the haiku encapsulates the beauty of fleeting moments where time and emotion converge, inviting readers to reflect on their own experiences of wonder.‚Äù

## Description

GutenKu is a creative, literature-inspired project that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP), Markov Chain algorithms, Vue.js, and MongoDB to generate haiku poetry. The project scrapes selected text data from Project Gutenberg, a vast online library of free eBooks. This data is then processed to extract quotes, generate unique haiku, and offer sentiment analysis of the created poems. Furthermore, GutenKu employs OpenAI to improve selection and provide descriptions for each haiku. Ultimately, the application generates images of the haikus.

## How it works

GutenKu operates by leveraging Python to scrape textual data from a curated whitelist of eBooks on Project Gutenberg. This gathered data is then processed through a Markov Chain, a probabilistic model that transitions from one state to another based on defined rules. The model is employed to identify and sequence sentences with the highest transition probabilities.

Once sentences are generated, Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques come into play. These techniques disassemble sentences into words, conduct sentiment analysis, and enforce the traditional 5-7-5 syllable structure of a haiku. The syllable counting is facilitated by the syllable library.

The processed chapters are stored in a MongoDB database, along with the generated haikus, improving the application's performance with a cache system based on TTL principles. GutenKu also incorporates OpenAI api to enhance haiku selection and to generate descriptive narratives for each haiku. In the final stage, the application creates ready-to-post images of the haikus.

The user-facing side of the application is powered by Vue.js 3, providing an interactive interface that not only displays the generated haikus. It also offers an advanced mode for more personalized and unique results.

## API Endpoint

GutenKu provides a GraphQL API for interacting with the service. The server is built using Apollo Server, a community-driven, open-source GraphQL server that works with any GraphQL schema.

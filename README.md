> _"This haiku sketches a stark moral contrast in three swift strokes. The opening line, “his part was finished,” suggests an ending that is both practical and ominous—someone has completed a task and is ready to step away, implying detachment or finality. The second line, “The workman was horrible,” sharpens the tone into judgement: the “workman” becomes a figure of cruelty or corruption, and the blunt adjective refuses nuance, as if the speaker cannot soften what has been witnessed. The final line, “Cosette was a light,” pivots into tenderness and symbolism. “Light” frames Cosette as innocence, hope, or salvation—something pure that exposes the workman’s ugliness by contrast. Read together, the poem compresses a whole narrative arc: brutal labor or wrongdoing, a cold completion, and then the sudden, humanizing presence of goodness that survives despite it."_

## About

GutenKu transforms classic literature from Project Gutenberg into haiku poetry using NLP, Markov Chain algorithms, and OpenAI for selection and narrative generation.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Selection** — OpenAI refines haiku choices and generates poetic narratives
- **Self-Learning** — Neural network discovers quality patterns by observing which haiku survive evolution
- **Daily Puzzle Game** — Guess the source book from haiku clues
- **Shareable Cards** — Generate beautiful image cards for social media
- **Sentiment Analysis** — Score and filter haikus by emotional tone

## How It Works

1. **Scrape** — Collect texts from a curated whitelist of eBooks on Project Gutenberg
2. **Process** — Apply Markov Chain to sequence sentences with highest transition probabilities
3. **Structure** — Enforce traditional 5-7-5 syllable structure via NLP
4. **Evolve** — Genetic algorithm optimizes haiku through natural selection; a neural network learns which patterns survive
5. **Select** — Choose candidates and generate narratives with OpenAI
6. **Render** — Create shareable image cards

## Quick Start

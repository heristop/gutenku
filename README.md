> 👩‍🏫 “This haiku captures a moment of deep reflection under the glow of the moon. The first line, 'I am thinking still,' suggests a sense of ongoing contemplation, indicating that the speaker has been lost in thought for some time. The phrase 'still' also conveys a sense of quietude and calmness, as if the world around has paused. The second line, 'In the brilliant moonlight,' shifts the focus to the setting, highlighting the moon's radiance as a backdrop to the speaker's introspection. The moonlight is often associated with clarity, enlightenment, and beauty, suggesting that the speaker's thoughts may be illuminated by the natural world's splendor. The final line, 'As fair as can be,' serves as a reflection of both the moonlight's beauty and possibly the nature of the speaker's thoughts. The word 'fair' can mean beautiful, just, or balanced, implying that the speaker finds a sense of peace or resolution in their contemplation. Overall, the haiku evokes a serene night scene where the external beauty of the moonlight mirrors the internal process of thoughtful meditation.”

## Description

GutenKu is a creative, literature-inspired project that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP), Markov Chain algorithms, Vue.js, and MongoDB to generate haiku poetry. The project scrapes selected text data from Project Gutenberg, a vast online library of free eBooks. This data is then processed to extract quotes, generate unique haiku, and offer sentiment analysis of the created poems. Furthermore, GutenKu employs OpenAI to improve selection and provide descriptions for each haiku. Ultimately, the application generates images of the haikus.

## How it works

GutenKu operates by leveraging Python to scrape textual data from a curated whitelist of eBooks on Project Gutenberg. This gathered data is then processed through a Markov Chain, a probabilistic model that transitions from one state to another based on defined rules. The model is employed to identify and sequence sentences with the highest transition probabilities.

Once sentences are generated, Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques come into play. These techniques disassemble sentences into words, conduct sentiment analysis, and enforce the traditional 5-7-5 syllable structure of a haiku. The syllable counting is facilitated by the syllable library.

The processed chapters are stored in a MongoDB database, along with the generated haikus, improving the application's performance with a cache system based on TTL principles. GutenKu also incorporates OpenAI api to enhance haiku selection and to generate descriptive narratives for each haiku. In the final stage, the application creates ready-to-post images of the haikus.

The user-facing side of the application is powered by Vue.js 3, providing an interactive interface that not only displays the generated haikus. It also offers an advanced mode for more personalized and unique results.

## API Endpoint

GutenKu provides a GraphQL API for interacting with the service. The server is built using Apollo Server, a community-driven, open-source GraphQL server that works with any GraphQL schema.

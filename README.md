> \_"This haiku presents a moment of stillness that turns unexpectedly intimate. The opening phrase, “as it stood before,” establishes a poised encounter—something in the natural world is positioned directly in the speaker’s presence, inviting attention and contemplation. Calling it “the ornament of nature” suggests beauty that feels deliberate and refined, like a decoration, yet still organic; it elevates the object from mere scenery to something worthy of reverence.

The final line, “asked me the reason,” introduces gentle personification. Nature is not passive here; it becomes an interrogator, prompting the speaker to examine their own motives—why they are watching, pausing, or perhaps seeking meaning. The haiku’s power lies in its reversal: instead of the human interpreting nature, nature seems to demand an explanation from the human. This creates a reflective, almost spiritual tone, implying that beauty carries a moral or philosophical challenge: to justify our gaze, our presence, or our relationship with the natural world."\_

## About

GutenKu transforms classic literature from Project Gutenberg into haiku poetry using NLP, Markov Chain algorithms, and OpenAI for selection and narrative generation.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Selection** — OpenAI refines haiku choices and generates poetic narratives
- **Self-Learning** — Neural network discovers quality patterns by observing which haiku survive evolution
- **Daily Puzzle Game** — Guess the source book from haiku clues
- **Shareable Cards** — Generate beautiful image cards for social media
- **Sentiment Analysis** — Score and filter haikus by emotional tone

## How It Works

1. **Scrape** — Collect texts from a curated whitelist of eBooks on Project Gutenberg
2. **Process** — Apply Markov Chain to sequence sentences with highest transition probabilities
3. **Structure** — Enforce traditional 5-7-5 syllable structure via NLP
4. **Evolve** — Genetic algorithm optimizes haiku through natural selection; a neural network learns which patterns survive
5. **Select** — Choose candidates and generate narratives with OpenAI
6. **Render** — Create shareable image cards

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/heristop/gutenku.git
cd gutenku

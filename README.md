> _"This haiku suggests that power is uncertain and temporary, while words can carry a different kind of strength. The phrase "you might have power" implies authority or control, but the word "might" makes it sound unstable or only possible, not guaranteed. "The heath occasionally" creates a natural, open landscape that feels changeable and quiet, suggesting moments that come and go. The final line, "his words was equal," implies that someone’s speech or voice stands on the same level as power itself, perhaps even challenging it. Overall, the haiku contrasts external power with the equalizing force of language, hinting that words can matter as much as status or strength."_

## About

GutenKu transforms classic literature from Project Gutenberg into haiku poetry using NLP, Markov Chain algorithms, and OpenAI for selection and narrative generation.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Selection** — OpenAI refines haiku choices and generates poetic narratives
- **Self-Learning** — Neural network discovers quality patterns by observing which haiku survive evolution
- **Daily Puzzle Game** — Guess the source book from haiku clues
- **Shareable Cards** — Generate beautiful image cards for social media
- **Sentiment Analysis** — Score and filter haikus by emotional tone

## How It Works

1. **Scrape** — Collect texts from a curated whitelist of eBooks on Project Gutenberg
2. **Process** — Apply Markov Chain to sequence sentences with highest transition probabilities
3. **Structure** — Enforce traditional 5-7-5 syllable structure via NLP
4. **Evolve** — Genetic algorithm optimizes haiku through natural selection; a neural network learns which patterns survive
5. **Select** — Choose candidates and generate narratives with OpenAI
6. **Render** — Create shareable image cards

## Quick Start

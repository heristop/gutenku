> _"This haiku suggests a sudden, sharp moment of betrayal or suspicion. The phrase "darting forth a prong" creates an image of something quick, pointed, and possibly dangerous, as if an attack or accusation has emerged. "Turning to my guide his face" introduces a person who should be trusted, a guide, but the shift in attention makes the moment feel uneasy, as though the speaker is searching for reassurance. The final line, "vessel of all guile," reveals the true emotional center of the poem: the guide’s face becomes a container of deceit, suggesting that the person who seemed trustworthy is actually full of cunning and trickery. The haiku is brief but powerful, using vivid imagery and a dramatic turn to explore the theme of hidden dishonesty."_

## About

GutenKu transforms classic literature from Project Gutenberg into haiku poetry using NLP, Markov Chain algorithms, and OpenAI for selection and narrative generation.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Selection** — OpenAI refines haiku choices and generates poetic narratives
- **Self-Learning** — Neural network discovers quality patterns by observing which haiku survive evolution
- **Daily Puzzle Game** — Guess the source book from haiku clues
- **Shareable Cards** — Generate beautiful image cards for social media
- **Sentiment Analysis** — Score and filter haikus by emotional tone

## How It Works

1. **Scrape** — Collect texts from a curated whitelist of eBooks on Project Gutenberg
2. **Process** — Apply Markov Chain to sequence sentences with highest transition probabilities
3. **Structure** — Enforce traditional 5-7-5 syllable structure via NLP
4. **Evolve** — Genetic algorithm optimizes haiku through natural selection; a neural network learns which patterns survive
5. **Select** — Choose candidates and generate narratives with OpenAI
6. **Render** — Create shareable image cards

## Quick Start

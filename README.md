> _"This haiku turns on a quiet paradox: a voice and a glance—things that are fleeting and intangible—are presented as powerful enough to make someone “fall.” The first line suggests seduction or influence through mere presence, implying that emotional impact can arrive without touch or overt action. The second line, “had she been able to fall,” introduces conditionality and restraint: the speaker imagines vulnerability, collapse, or surrender, yet hints that she cannot—or will not—give in. The final line, “You can bear plenty,” shifts from observation to counsel, sounding like reassurance after temptation or hardship. It implies endurance: even if desire, grief, or pressure threatens to topple you, you are capable of carrying more than you think. Overall, the poem compresses a narrative of attraction, withheld vulnerability, and hard-won resilience into three spare lines."_

## About

GutenKu transforms classic literature from Project Gutenberg into haiku poetry using NLP, Markov Chain algorithms, and OpenAI for selection and narrative generation.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Selection** — OpenAI refines haiku choices and generates poetic narratives
- **Self-Learning** — Neural network discovers quality patterns by observing which haiku survive evolution
- **Daily Puzzle Game** — Guess the source book from haiku clues
- **Shareable Cards** — Generate beautiful image cards for social media
- **Sentiment Analysis** — Score and filter haikus by emotional tone

## How It Works

1. **Scrape** — Collect texts from a curated whitelist of eBooks on Project Gutenberg
2. **Process** — Apply Markov Chain to sequence sentences with highest transition probabilities
3. **Structure** — Enforce traditional 5-7-5 syllable structure via NLP
4. **Evolve** — Genetic algorithm optimizes haiku through natural selection; a neural network learns which patterns survive
5. **Select** — Choose candidates and generate narratives with OpenAI
6. **Render** — Create shareable image cards

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/heristop/gutenku.git

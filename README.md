> 👩‍🏫 “This haiku captures a moment of poignant emotion, likely tied to a narrative involving the character Ráma, a reference to the protagonist of the Indian epic Ramayana. The first line, 'Graced and honoured long,' suggests a history of dignity and respect, implying that the subject has been held in high esteem over time. The second line, 'As a tear bedewed her eye,' introduces a shift to a more intimate scene, where a single tear moistens the eye of a woman, possibly indicating a moment of deep feeling or a response to an event that has moved her. The tear could symbolize a mix of emotions, such as joy, sorrow, or gratitude. The final line, 'Be to Ráma told,' directs that this emotional moment should be conveyed to Ráma, hinting at a connection between the woman's experience and Ráma himself. The haiku leaves much to the imagination, inviting readers to ponder the circumstances that led to this tearful moment and the message that is to be passed on to Ráma.”

## Description

GutenKu is a creative, literature-inspired project that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP), Markov Chain algorithms, Vue.js, and MongoDB to generate haiku poetry. The project scrapes selected text data from Project Gutenberg, a vast online library of free eBooks. This data is then processed to extract quotes, generate unique haiku, and offer sentiment analysis of the created poems. Furthermore, GutenKu employs OpenAI to improve selection and provide descriptions for each haiku. Ultimately, the application generates images of the haikus for posting on Instagram.

## How it works

GutenKu operates by leveraging Python to scrape textual data from a curated whitelist of eBooks on Project Gutenberg. This gathered data is then processed through a Markov Chain, a probabilistic model that transitions from one state to another based on defined rules. The model is employed to identify and sequence sentences with the highest transition probabilities.

Once sentences are generated, Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques come into play. These techniques disassemble sentences into words, conduct sentiment analysis, and enforce the traditional 5-7-5 syllable structure of a haiku. The syllable counting is facilitated by the syllable library.

The processed chapters are stored in a MongoDB database, along with the generated haikus, improving the application's performance with a cache system based on TTL principles. GutenKu also incorporates OpenAI api to enhance haiku selection and to generate descriptive narratives for each haiku. In the final stage, the application creates ready-to-post images of the haikus for Instagram.

The user-facing side of the application is powered by Vue.js 3, providing an interactive interface that not only displays the generated haikus. It also offers an advanced mode for more personalized and unique results.

## API Endpoint

GutenKu provides a GraphQL API for interacting with the service. The server is built using Apollo Server, a community-driven, open-source GraphQL server that works with any GraphQL schema.

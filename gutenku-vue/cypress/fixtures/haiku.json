                "content": " Stowing Down and Clearing Up.\n\n\nAlready has it been related how the great leviathan is afar off\ndescried from the mast-head; how he is chased over the watery moors, and\nslaughtered in the valleys of the deep; how he is then towed alongside\nand beheaded; and how (on the principle which entitled the headsman of\nold to the garments in which the beheaded was killed) his great padded\nsurtout becomes the property of his executioner; how, in due time, he\nis condemned to the pots, and, like Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, his\nspermaceti, oil, and bone pass unscathed through the fire;--but now it\nremains to conclude the last chapter of this part of the description by\nrehearsing--singing, if I may--the romantic proceeding of decanting off\nhis oil into the casks and striking them down into the hold, where\nonce again leviathan returns to his native profundities, sliding along\nbeneath the surface as before; but, alas! never more to rise and blow.\n\nWhile still warm, the oil, like hot punch, is received into the\nsix-barrel casks; and while, perhaps, the ship is pitching and rolling\nthis way and that in the midnight sea, the enormous casks are slewed\nround and headed over, end for end, and sometimes perilously scoot\nacross the slippery deck, like so many land slides, till at last\nman-handled and stayed in their course; and all round the hoops, rap,\nrap, go as many hammers as can play upon them, for now, EX OFFICIO,\nevery sailor is a cooper.\n\nAt length, when the last pint is casked, and all is cool, then the great\nhatchways are unsealed, the bowels of the ship are thrown open, and down\ngo the casks to their final rest in the sea. This done, the hatches are\nreplaced, and hermetically closed, like a closet walled up.\n\nIn the sperm fishery, this is perhaps one of the most remarkable\nincidents in all the business of whaling. One day the planks stream with\nfreshets of blood and oil; on the sacred quarter-deck enormous masses of\nthe whale's head are profanely piled; great rusty casks lie about, as\nin a brewery yard; the smoke from the try-works has besooted all the\nbulwarks; the mariners go about suffused with unctuousness; the entire\nship seems great leviathan himself; while on all hands the din is\ndeafening.\n\nBut a day or two after, you look about you, and prick your ears in this\nself-same ship; and were it not for the tell-tale boats and try-works,\nyou would all but swear you trod some silent merchant vessel, with a\nmost scrupulously neat commander. The unmanufactured sperm oil possesses\na singularly cleansing virtue. This is the reason why the decks never\nlook so white as just after what they call an affair of oil. Besides,\nfrom the ashes of the burned scraps of the whale, a potent lye is\nreadily made; and whenever any adhesiveness from the back of the whale\nremains clinging to the side, that lye quickly exterminates it. Hands\ngo diligently along the bulwarks, and with buckets of water and rags\nrestore them to their full tidiness. The soot is brushed from the lower\nrigging. All the numerous implements which have been in use are likewise\nfaithfully cleansed and put away. The great hatch is scrubbed and placed\nupon the try-works, completely hiding the pots; every cask is out of\nsight; all tackles are coiled in unseen nooks; and when by the combined\nand simultaneous industry of almost the entire ship's company, the\nwhole of this conscientious duty is at last concluded, then the crew\nthemselves proceed to their own ablutions; shift themselves from top to\ntoe; and finally issue to the immaculate deck, fresh and all aglow, as\nbridegrooms new-leaped from out the daintiest Holland.\n\nNow, with elated step, they pace the planks in twos and threes, and\nhumorously discourse of parlors, sofas, carpets, and fine cambrics;\npropose to mat the deck; think of having hanging to the top; object not\nto taking tea by moonlight on the piazza of the forecastle. To hint to\nsuch musked mariners of oil, and bone, and blubber, were little short\nof audacity. They know not the thing you distantly allude to. Away, and\nbring us napkins!\n\nBut mark: aloft there, at the three mast heads, stand three men intent\non spying out more whales, which, if caught, infallibly will again\nsoil the old oaken furniture, and drop at least one small grease-spot\nsomewhere. Yes; and many is the time, when, after the severest\nuninterrupted labors, which know no night; continuing straight through\nfor ninety-six hours; when from the boat, where they have swelled their\nwrists with all day rowing on the Line,--they only step to the deck to\ncarry vast chains, and heave the heavy windlass, and cut and slash, yea,\nand in their very sweatings to be smoked and burned anew by the combined\nfires of the equatorial sun and the equatorial try-works; when, on the\nheel of all this, they have finally bestirred themselves to cleanse the\nship, and make a spotless dairy room of it; many is the time the poor\nfellows, just buttoning the necks of their clean frocks, are startled by\nthe cry of \"There she blows!\" and away they fly to fight another whale,\nand go through the whole weary thing again. Oh! my friends, but this\nis man-killing! Yet this is life. For hardly have we mortals by long\ntoilings extracted from this world's vast bulk its small but valuable\nsperm; and then, with weary patience, cleansed ourselves from its\ndefilements, and learned to live here in clean tabernacles of the soul;\nhardly is this done, when--THERE SHE BLOWS!--the ghost is spouted up,\nand away we sail to fight some other world, and go through young life's\nold routine again.\n\nOh! the metempsychosis! Oh! Pythagoras, that in bright Greece, two\nthousand years ago, did die, so good, so wise, so mild; I sailed with\nthee along the Peruvian coast last voyage--and, foolish as I am, taught\nthee, a green simple boy, how to splice a rope!\n\n\n\n",

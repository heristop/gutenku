This haiku captures the transient essence of time and knowledge. The first line, 'It is through knowing,' suggests that awareness or understanding plays a crucial role in our perception of time. The second line, 'That ceased also to be long,' implies that once something is understood or known, its duration seems to shorten, highlighting the fleeting nature of moments once they are comprehended. The final line, 'That I measure time,' ties the concept together, indicating that our grasp of time is intrinsically linked to our awareness and understanding. The haiku beautifully encapsulates the idea that time feels shorter as we become more aware of its passage, emphasizing the ephemeral quality of life and moments.

This haiku captures a moment of introspection and nostalgia. The speaker looks back with a sense of sadness, perhaps reflecting on a past experience or place that was once filled with 'brilliant light.' The contrast between the current feeling of melancholy and the memory of brightness suggests a longing for a time or place that was once fulfilling or joyful. The phrase 'That was a good place' implies a sense of loss or change, highlighting the transient nature of happiness and the human tendency to reminisce about the past. The haiku's brevity and vivid imagery evoke a powerful emotional response, inviting readers to reflect on their own memories and the passage of time.

This haiku presents a serene yet whimsical scene, inviting the reader to ponder a choice between two seemingly unrelated activities. The first line, 'Which to attend to,' sets up a moment of decision, suggesting a pause to consider priorities. The second line, 'A beautifully calm race,' introduces a paradoxical image, as races are typically associated with speed and urgency, yet here it is described as calm, evoking a sense of peace and tranquility. The final line, 'Taking up biscuits,' adds a touch of humor and domesticity, contrasting the idea of a race with the simple pleasure of enjoying biscuits. This haiku captures the essence of finding beauty and calm in everyday choices, encouraging mindfulness and appreciation of life's small moments.

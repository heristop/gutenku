This haiku captures a tender moment of anticipation, set against the quiet drama of a moonrise. The opening line, "just as the moon rose," establishes a calm, luminous backdrop and suggests a shift from day to night—a time when feelings often become clearer and more intimate. The second line, "write you very soon again," introduces a voice reaching out across distance; the act of writing becomes both a promise and a lifeline, implying separation but also devotion. The final line, "coming close to me," turns the poem inward, transforming the physical image of the rising moon into an emotional movement toward closeness. Overall, the haiku blends nature and human longing: the moon’s steady ascent mirrors the speaker’s hope that connection—through words, memory, or reunion—will steadily draw nearer.

This haiku captures the essence of human pride and its consequences. The first line, 'Proud as he is,' introduces a figure characterized by arrogance and self-importance. The second line, 'Our humble prayer denies,' suggests that this prideful attitude leads to a rejection of humility and perhaps a dismissal of collective or spiritual supplication. The final line, 'And naked to the sky,' evokes a sense of vulnerability and exposure, implying that pride ultimately leaves one defenseless and bare before the vastness of the universe. The haiku succinctly portrays the tension between pride and humility, and the inevitable exposure that comes with excessive pride.

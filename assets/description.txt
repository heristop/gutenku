This haiku captures a moment of quiet observation and introspection. The first line, 'Their backs towards us,' suggests a scene where people or perhaps animals are facing away, creating a sense of distance or separation. The second line, 'As his lips unclosed to ask,' introduces a moment of potential communication, a question that is about to be asked, adding a layer of anticipation. The final line, 'I went through rich scenes,' indicates that the speaker is mentally or emotionally transported through vivid and enriching experiences, possibly triggered by the unfolding scene or the impending question. The haiku beautifully encapsulates the interplay between observation, communication, and internal reflection, all within the natural world.

This haiku captures a moment of quiet determination in the natural world. The 'majestic beast' symbolizes strength and resilience, yet it is 'dumb,' or silent, suggesting a calm acceptance or readiness for the challenges ahead. As winter approaches, the beast's silence may reflect a contemplative state, preparing for the harshness of the season. The haiku evokes a sense of respect for nature's cycles and the quiet strength found in adaptation and perseverance.

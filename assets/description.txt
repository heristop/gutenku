This haiku captures a moment of anticipation and belief, as the speaker senses the return of something significant. The phrase 'Here it comes again' suggests a recurring event or feeling, perhaps a familiar experience or emotion. The speaker's conviction is emphasized with 'As I verily believe,' indicating a strong, almost instinctual trust in what is to come. The final line, 'It would soar cloud-high,' evokes imagery of something ascending to great heights, symbolizing hope, aspiration, or the potential for greatness. The haiku beautifully encapsulates the theme of expectation and the uplifting nature of belief.

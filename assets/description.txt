This haiku encapsulates the transient nature of life and the inevitable approach of death. The opening line, 'The mists cleared away,' suggests a moment of clarity or revelation, where the fog of uncertainty dissipates, revealing stark truths. The phrase 'In all probability' introduces a sense of inevitability and realism, indicating that while life is often shrouded in ambiguity, the outcome—death—is a certainty we all face. The concluding line, 'To become our tomb,' starkly underscores this theme, transforming the clarity gained from the mists into a somber acceptance of mortality. Together, these lines evoke a contemplative mood, inviting readers to reflect on the passage of time and the ultimate fate that awaits us all.

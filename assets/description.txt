This haiku captures the essence of paradise through the lens of perception and critique. The 'paradisal air' suggests an idyllic, almost heavenly atmosphere, inviting readers to imagine a place of ultimate beauty and tranquility. However, the phrase 'as some narrators suppose' introduces a layer of subjectivity, hinting that this view of paradise is not universally accepted. The final line, 'it is over-rich,' suggests that this paradise might be excessive or overwhelming, challenging the notion that more is always better. This haiku invites readers to reflect on the idea that even perfection can have its drawbacks, and that beauty and richness are often in the eye of the beholder.

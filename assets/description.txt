This haiku captures a moment of unexpected interaction with nature, where the speaker experiences a sudden, yet fortunate, encounter. The first line, 'Luckily for me,' sets a tone of gratitude and relief, suggesting that the speaker narrowly avoided an unpleasant situation. The second line, 'It first buzzed over my head,' introduces the presence of an insect, likely a bee or a similar creature, creating a sense of immediacy and movement. The final line, 'All at once she flushed,' evokes a vivid image of a bird or another creature suddenly taking flight, perhaps startled by the buzzing. This haiku beautifully encapsulates the unpredictability and interconnectedness of nature, highlighting a moment where the speaker is both an observer and a participant in the natural world.

This haiku paints a vivid image of a scene at sea, where the 'golden helmeted suns' symbolize the sun's rays glistening on the water, resembling helmets. The phrase 'curious to tell' suggests a sense of wonder or intrigue, as if the sun is observing or interacting with the subject, possibly a sailor or a ship, from both the front ('fore') and back ('aft'). The imagery evokes a sense of protection and guidance, as the sun's light envelops the traveler, highlighting the beauty and mystery of the natural world.

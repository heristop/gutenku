This haiku poignantly captures the sorrow of loss through the delicate imagery of a nightingale's song. The first line, 'That such things must be,' sets a tone of inevitability and acceptance, suggesting that loss is a natural part of life. The second line introduces the nightingale, a bird often associated with poetic beauty and melancholy, singing in the night. This evokes a sense of mourning and reflection. The final line, 'My dear mother gone,' reveals the personal nature of the grief, grounding the universal experience of loss in a deeply intimate moment. The juxtaposition of the nightingale's song with the sorrow of losing a mother creates a powerful emotional resonance, blending nature's beauty with human sorrow.

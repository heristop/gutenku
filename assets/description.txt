This haiku captures the nebulous nature of human emotions and desires. The 'uncertain outline' suggests something that is indistinct and elusive, much like the feelings of the heart and the complexities of life. The repetition of 'longing' emphasizes an intense desire to understand or grasp these uncertainties. It's a reflection on the human condition, where the pursuit of knowledge and self-awareness is both a journey and a yearning. The haiku beautifully encapsulates the essence of seeking clarity in the midst of life's ambiguities.

This haiku presents a portrait of endurance shaped by conflict. The opening question—"who is still living"—immediately frames survival as something remarkable, even uncertain, as if the speaker is taking stock after devastation. The second line, "In this he was successful," shifts from mere existence to achievement: staying alive becomes a hard-won victory rather than a passive fact. The final line, "in fierce battles won," supplies the cause and the cost, suggesting that the subject’s continued life is inseparable from violent struggle and triumph. Overall, the poem compresses a larger narrative of war into a few stark phrases, implying that survival and success can be measured in battles—but also hinting at the unspoken losses that make such success feel severe rather than celebratory.

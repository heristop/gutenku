This haiku captures a moment of transition and newfound independence. The opening line, 'The rain was over,' suggests the end of a storm, both literally and metaphorically, indicating a shift from turmoil to calm. The second line, 'A very handsome filly,' introduces an image of beauty and vitality, perhaps symbolizing a fresh start or a new opportunity. The final line, 'I can go alone,' reflects a sense of self-reliance and confidence, as if the speaker has found strength in solitude after the storm has passed. Together, these lines convey a journey from adversity to self-assuredness, using nature and imagery to illustrate personal growth.

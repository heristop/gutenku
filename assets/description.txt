This haiku captures a moment of dramatic transition in nature. It opens with “The silent ocean,” establishing a calm, almost reverent stillness, as if the sea is holding its breath. The second line—“The sun rose red and fiery”—introduces vivid imagery and a shift in mood: the colour red suggests both beauty and warning, while “fiery” gives the sunrise an intense, energetic force. In the final line, “With a rising gale,” the poem turns from quiet to movement, hinting that the calm is temporary and that change—perhaps a storm—is gathering. Overall, the haiku contrasts serenity with impending turbulence, using concise sensory details to show how quickly the natural world can transform.

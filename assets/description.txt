This haiku captures a speaker caught between regret and revision. The opening plea, “do go back to him,” reads like an urgent instruction—perhaps to the self, perhaps to someone else—suggesting a desire to undo distance or abandonment. The middle line, “that he had not broken down,” introduces the emotional stakes: the man’s collapse is imagined as a consequence of leaving, and the grammar’s slight awkwardness mirrors the speaker’s unsettled guilt. “In the retrospect” frames the whole moment as hindsight—too late for certainty, but vivid in self-reproach. Overall, the poem becomes a small study of remorse: the mind replaying the past, trying to restore someone’s strength by rewriting the choice that may have hurt him.

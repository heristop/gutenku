This haiku paints a vivid image of a person whose wisdom is almost tangible, resting like a crown upon their forehead. The phrase 'It belongs to him' suggests a sense of ownership or natural possession, indicating that this wisdom is an inherent part of the individual. The 'mass on his forehead' could symbolize the weight or accumulation of knowledge and experience, perhaps even suggesting a physical manifestation of thought or intellect. The final line, 'With serene wisdom,' conveys a sense of calm and tranquility, implying that this wisdom is not burdensome but rather a source of peace and understanding. The haiku captures the essence of wisdom as both a personal and visible attribute, one that is both profound and serene.

This haiku captures a moment of transient clarity as the mists dissipate, revealing a stark reality. The first line, 'The mists cleared away,' suggests a lifting of confusion or uncertainty, allowing for a brief glimpse of truth. The second line, 'In all probability,' introduces a sense of inevitability or fate, hinting that what is revealed is not just a possibility but a likely outcome. The final line, 'To become our tomb,' delivers a somber twist, suggesting that the clarity gained leads to an understanding of mortality or an inescapable end. This haiku beautifully juxtaposes the fleeting nature of insight with the permanence of death, inviting reflection on the transient nature of life and the certainty of its conclusion.

This haiku captures a moment of tranquility and beauty following a rain shower. The phrase "The rain was over" suggests a cleansing or renewal, symbolizing the end of turmoil and the beginning of clarity. The mention of a "very handsome filly" evokes a sense of grace and vitality, bringing to mind imagery of youth and freedom, often associated with nature. The concluding line, "For I deserve it," introduces a layer of introspection, indicating that the speaker feels a sense of entitlement or personal reward for enduring life's challenges. Together, these elements convey a message of appreciation for beauty and the importance of recognizing one's worth after hardship.

This haiku captures a moment of longing and transcendence. The speaker expresses a deep desire to hear a voice, perhaps a loved one or a divine presence. The phrase 'To heaven again shall go' suggests a return to a celestial or spiritual realm, indicating a cycle of departure and return. The 'air-borne car' is a metaphor for a vehicle that transcends earthly bounds, symbolizing the soul's journey or a divine chariot. The haiku beautifully intertwines themes of yearning, spirituality, and the ethereal nature of existence.

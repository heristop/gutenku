The final line, 'All the stars and light,' ties the imagery together, emphasizing the interconnectedness of the universe, where stars and light symbolize purity, guidance, and the omnipresence of a higher power. The haiku beautifully intertwines themes of spirituality, nature, and cosmic order, inviting readers to reflect on the harmony between the earthly and the divine.

This haiku captures a moment of introspection and emotional depth. The 'tears in his eyes' suggest a profound emotional experience, possibly of joy, sorrow, or realization. The phrase 'of their own goodness alone' implies a contemplation of inherent virtue or purity, perhaps suggesting that true goodness exists independently of external validation. The final line, 'even of good things,' may reflect on the complexity of emotions, where even positive experiences can evoke tears. This haiku invites readers to ponder the duality of emotions and the intrinsic value of goodness.

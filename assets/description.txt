The second line, 'Of all these beautiful things,' points to the myriad of wonders that exist in the world, both natural and man-made. The final line, 'And things great and small,' emphasizes the inclusivity of this beauty, acknowledging that both grand and minute elements contribute to the tapestry of life. Together, these lines evoke a sense of anticipation and appreciation for the ongoing act of creation, urging us to recognize the value in everything around us, no matter its size or significance.

This haiku captures the essence of silent judgment and the unspoken decisions we make about others based on appearances. The first line, 'Fair to look upon,' suggests an initial attraction or approval based on visual appeal. The second line, 'This mentally decided,' reveals the internal process of forming an opinion or decision without verbal communication. The final line, 'Where thou art welcome,' implies that this judgment determines the level of acceptance or welcome one receives. The haiku subtly critiques the superficial nature of such judgments, inviting readers to reflect on their own biases and the impact of appearances on social interactions.

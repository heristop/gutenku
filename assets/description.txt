This haiku captures the moment of dawn breaking, as the light returns to the world. 'Shine in arms again' suggests the sun's rays embracing the earth, symbolizing a renewal of warmth and life. The 'ivory-studded reins' evoke the image of a majestic chariot, perhaps drawing on mythological imagery of the sun being guided across the sky. This line emphasizes the elegance and power of the morning light. Finally, 'And restores the day' signifies the return of daylight, dispelling the darkness of night and rejuvenating the world. The haiku beautifully encapsulates the cyclical nature of day and night, and the perpetual hope and renewal that each dawn brings.

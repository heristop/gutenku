This haiku beautifully captures the transformative power of nature in alleviating human burdens. The phrase 'Pressed down by care' suggests a state of stress or worry, a common human experience. The poet contrasts this with the image of a 'fair lotus,' a symbol of purity and enlightenment in many cultures. The lotus serves as a visual and emotional balm, offering a sense of peace and beauty that transcends the speaker's immediate concerns. The haiku implies that immersing oneself in the natural world can provide a profound sense of relief and perspective, making life's burdens seem lighter.

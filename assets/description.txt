This haiku captures a swift shift in mood and motion. It opens with “The silent ocean,” establishing a calm, almost reverent stillness that feels timeless and watchful. The second line—“The sun rose red and fiery”—introduces vivid colour and intensity, suggesting both beauty and a hint of danger, as if the day is being forged in heat. In the final line, “With a rising gale,” the poem pivots from stillness to disturbance: the wind gathers, and the tranquil seascape becomes charged with energy. The haiku’s power lies in this contrast—quiet versus force, serenity versus impending turbulence—implying that nature’s moods can change in an instant, and that splendour often arrives alongside unease.

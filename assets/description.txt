This haiku captures a moment of profound respect and awe as one encounters a majestic, solitary figure—referred to as a 'glorious hermit'—who releases an arrow from a 'Heavenly Bow.' The imagery suggests a divine or otherworldly archer, perhaps symbolizing a natural phenomenon like a shooting star or a comet. The 'reverence' indicates the observer's deep admiration and humility in the face of such a magnificent sight. The 'Heavenly Bow' could also be interpreted as a rainbow, adding layers of meaning related to beauty, transience, and the sublime aspects of nature.

This haiku captures a moment of reflection amidst the hustle and bustle of a market-place. The first line sets the scene, placing us in the midst of commerce and community. The second line, 'The whole sky was overcast,' suggests a heaviness or a blanket of clouds that could mirror the mood of the speaker or the atmosphere of the market. It may also imply a sense of oppression or foreboding. The final line, 'And farther away,' invites the reader to look beyond the immediate surroundings, hinting at a vastness or a longing for escape. The haiku's beauty lies in its brevity and its ability to evoke both a specific setting and a universal emotion. It speaks to the human experience of feeling small or overwhelmed in a busy world, while also recognizing the existence of a wider, perhaps more tranquil, reality beyond.

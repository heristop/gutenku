This haiku captures a moment of longing and transcendence. The speaker expresses a deep desire to hear a voice, perhaps of a loved one or a divine entity. The phrase 'To heaven again shall go' suggests a return to a celestial or spiritual realm, indicating a cyclical journey between earth and the heavens. The 'air-borne car' symbolizes a vehicle of ascension, possibly a metaphor for the soul's journey or a literal vision of a chariot in the sky. The haiku beautifully intertwines themes of yearning, spirituality, and the ethereal nature of existence.

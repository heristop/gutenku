This haiku captures the essence of a new beginning, as suggested by the imagery of 'shining arms' and 'ivory-studded reins.' The 'arms' could symbolize the first light of dawn breaking through the darkness, while the 'ivory-studded reins' evoke a sense of control and elegance, guiding the day forward. The final line, 'And restores the day,' suggests a renewal or revival, as if the day is being brought back to life after the night. The poem beautifully encapsulates the transition from night to day, emphasizing themes of hope and renewal.

This haiku captures a moment of serene reflection and the interplay between the natural world and the ethereal. The speaker describes a personal experience of bathing in a river, a setting that often symbolizes purification and rebirth in literature. The 'white figures' seen in the water evoke a sense of mystery and otherworldliness, suggesting the presence of spirits or memories that linger in the depths of the river. The use of the phrase 'as it seemed to me' introduces a subjective lens, hinting at the elusive nature of perception and reality. This haiku invites readers to ponder the boundaries between the physical and the spiritual, as well as the beauty found in quiet moments of introspection.

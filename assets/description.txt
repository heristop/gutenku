This haiku presents a contemplative view of paradise, suggesting that the air of such a place, often idealized by narrators, might be excessively rich. The first line, 'Paradisal air,' evokes an image of a perfect, serene environment. The second line, 'As some narrators suppose,' introduces a layer of skepticism, hinting that this idealization is a narrative construct rather than an absolute truth. The final line, 'It is over-rich,' suggests that the abundance of paradise might be overwhelming or even suffocating, challenging the notion that more is always better. This haiku invites readers to question the narratives of perfection and consider the complexities that lie beneath surface-level beauty.

This haiku explores themes of empathy, racial identity, and the subjective experience of time. The first line, 'Do not weep for me,' suggests a plea for emotional restraint or understanding. The second line, 'Your skin is darker than mine,' introduces a racial element, hinting at the complexities and perhaps the injustices faced by the person being addressed. The final line, 'How long those hours seemed,' conveys a sense of prolonged suffering or waiting, which could be interpreted as a shared experience of hardship. Together, the haiku invites readers to reflect on the interconnectedness of human experiences across different racial backgrounds and the passage of time.

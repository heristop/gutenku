This haiku juxtaposes the joy of May with the separation experienced on whaling ships. The first line, 'In some glad May-time,' evokes a sense of happiness and renewal associated with spring. However, the following lines introduce a stark contrast. 'They seemed pole-like asunder' suggests a vast distance or separation, much like the poles of the Earth. This separation is further emphasized by the setting of 'whaling-ships,' which historically embarked on long, isolating voyages. The haiku captures the tension between the joy of nature's renewal and the isolation of human endeavors, reflecting on how physical and emotional distances can feel insurmountable even in times of natural beauty.

The second line, 'They had all been kind to us,' evokes a sense of community and the warmth of human kindness. The final line, 'In wind and sunshine,' contrasts the challenges and joys of life, symbolized by wind and sunshine, respectively. Together, these lines create a vivid image of appreciation for the kindness received through life's varied experiences.

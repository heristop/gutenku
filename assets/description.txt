This haiku captures the juxtaposition between internal turmoil and external clarity. The first line, 'When she again lived,' suggests a return to a familiar state of being, possibly one of emotional distress or introspection. The phrase 'In this painful state of mind' in the second line deepens the sense of personal struggle, indicating a recurring or persistent emotional challenge. However, the final line, 'Your summits are clear,' introduces a contrasting image of clarity and elevation. The 'summits' symbolize a higher perspective or a moment of insight that remains unaffected by the internal chaos. This haiku beautifully illustrates how, even amidst personal pain, there can be moments of clarity and understanding, much like clear mountain peaks rising above turbulent clouds.

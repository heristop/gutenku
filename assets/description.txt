This haiku captures a moment of transition and revelation. The clearing of the mists symbolizes the lifting of confusion or uncertainty, suggesting a newfound clarity or understanding. The phrase 'in all probability' introduces an element of uncertainty or expectation, hinting at the natural unpredictability of life. The mention of 'the evening' evokes a sense of closure or resolution, as the day winds down and clarity is achieved. This haiku beautifully encapsulates the ephemeral nature of insight and the quiet moments of realization that often come at the end of a day.

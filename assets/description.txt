This haiku captures a moment of serene contemplation amidst a seemingly mundane activity. The phrase 'Which to attend to' suggests a moment of decision-making, perhaps reflective of the complexities of daily life. The 'beautifully calm race' juxtaposes the tranquility of the scene with the notion of a race, implying that even in the hustle and bustle, there can be calmness. The final line, 'Taking up biscuits,' introduces a playful and comforting image, suggesting a shared experience or simple pleasure that can ground us in moments of choice. Overall, the haiku conveys a sense of mindfulness in the face of life’s small decisions, celebrating the beauty of the ordinary.

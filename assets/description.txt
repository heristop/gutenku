This haiku captures a moment of profound tranquility and introspection. The opening line, 'All waiting for me,' suggests a sense of anticipation or expectation, as if the world holds its breath for the speaker's presence. The second line, 'Which seemed to us deserted,' evokes a shared experience of solitude, where the surroundings appear empty yet inviting. This emptiness is not foreboding but rather a canvas for reflection. The final line, 'And made the sea calm,' ties the natural world to the speaker's inner state, suggesting that their presence or realization brings peace to the environment. The sea, often a symbol of vastness and emotion, is calmed, indicating a harmonious balance between the external world and the speaker's internal peace.

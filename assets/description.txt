This haiku captures a moment of introspection and hope amidst adversity. The speaker, who refers to themselves as 'Mate,' suggests a return to a state of cheerfulness, perhaps after a period of struggle or emotional turmoil. The sea is personified as a savior, offering solace and protection from an unspecified 'Him,' which could symbolize a person, a force, or a situation causing distress. The final line, 'Come good wind or foul,' reflects a resilient and determined attitude, embracing whatever challenges or fortunes may arise. The speaker's reliance on the sea and the winds underscores a deep connection with nature and a trust in its ability to guide and protect them through life's uncertainties.

This haiku captures the serene and undisturbed nature of a mountain lake, drawing a parallel to the clarity and purity of thought. The 'head' symbolizes the mind, which, like the 'absolutely pure' and 'tideless' waters, is calm and untroubled. The imagery of 'mountain lakes' evokes a sense of tranquility and isolation, suggesting a mental state free from the chaos and distractions of everyday life. The poem invites readers to find peace and clarity within themselves, much like the stillness found in nature's untouched beauty.

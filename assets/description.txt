This haiku captures the transient nature of human greatness. The phrase 'An excellent man' sets the stage, highlighting an individual of remarkable qualities. The second line, 'Like all sublunary things,' places this excellence within the realm of earthly, and therefore temporary, existence. The final line, 'That is beautiful,' underscores the inherent beauty in this fleeting excellence. The haiku suggests that all things, no matter how splendid, are subject to the passage of time, emphasizing the beauty in their impermanence.

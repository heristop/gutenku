This haiku captures the juxtaposition between internal chaos and external tranquility. The first line, 'When she again lived,' suggests a return to a familiar state of being, possibly hinting at a recurring emotional struggle. The 'painful state of mind' in the second line conveys a sense of inner turmoil or distress that the subject is experiencing. Despite this internal conflict, the final line, 'All around was calm,' highlights the contrast between her mental state and the serene environment surrounding her. This haiku beautifully illustrates the theme of inner versus outer worlds, emphasizing how one's internal emotions can be at odds with the external peace that exists around them.

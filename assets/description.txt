This haiku sketches a vast journey of perspective: it begins with the solidity of “Mountains,” then opens outward to the “sea,” moving from the fixed and towering to the boundless and shifting. In the middle line, “Person in the universe,” the speaker places human life between these immensities—small, momentary, yet conscious enough to witness and belong. The final line, “The sun from rising,” introduces renewal and time: dawn suggests beginnings, clarity, and the daily reassurance that light returns. Taken together, the poem balances scale (earth, ocean, cosmos) with a quiet human presence, implying that meaning is found not by dominating the landscape, but by standing humbly within it as the world turns toward morning.

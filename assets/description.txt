This haiku captures the juxtaposition between internal chaos and external tranquility. The first line, 'When she again lived,' suggests a return to a familiar state, hinting at a recurring emotional struggle. The 'painful state of mind' in the second line emphasizes the depth of her inner turmoil. However, the final line, 'All around was calm,' contrasts sharply with her internal experience, highlighting the dissonance between her inner world and the serene environment around her. This contrast underscores the theme of isolation and the often invisible nature of personal suffering.

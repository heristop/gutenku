The haiku moves in widening circles: from the solid certainty of “Mountains,” to the vast openness of “the sea,” and then to the smallest yet most conscious presence—“Person in the universe.” This progression suggests perspective: nature’s grandeur frames human life, but does not erase it. The final line, “The sun from rising,” introduces a moment of beginning and renewal, as if the speaker is witnessing creation happen in real time. The slightly unusual phrasing makes the sunrise feel less like a simple event and more like a cosmic force emerging, linking the personal and the planetary. Overall, the poem balances humility and belonging: the human figure is tiny against mountains and ocean, yet still placed meaningfully within the universe’s daily rebirth.

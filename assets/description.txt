This haiku captures a moment of profound veneration and spiritual connection. The phrase 'Was sacred to her' suggests a deep, personal significance, perhaps a cherished memory or a revered figure. The imagery of 'His head surrounded with rays' evokes a sense of divinity or enlightenment, as if the subject is bathed in a holy light. The final line, 'Transparent amber,' adds a layer of mystique and timelessness, suggesting that this sacred moment is preserved in a state of eternal beauty, much like an insect trapped in amber. The haiku, with its concise yet evocative language, invites readers to ponder the intersection of the sacred and the ephemeral.

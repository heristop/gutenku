This haiku captures a moment in a bustling market-place where the sky is overcast, suggesting an impending change in weather or mood. The imagery of the 'whole sky' being overcast evokes a sense of heaviness and anticipation, as if the atmosphere is charged with the potential for rain or a storm. The phrase 'farther away' implies a sense of distance or longing, perhaps hinting at the idea that beyond the immediate environment, there is something unknown or unreachable. The haiku encapsulates a transient moment, blending the mundane with the profound, as the market's lively energy contrasts with the somber sky above.

This haiku captures a moment of serene unity in nature, where all elements seem to have come together in a peaceful coexistence. The phrase 'all gone together' suggests a merging or blending of entities, perhaps referring to the natural elements or creatures that inhabit the hedge side. The hedge, often a boundary or a meeting point, symbolizes a place where differences dissolve into harmony. 'This comes of the peace' implies that such unity is a result of tranquility and absence of conflict, highlighting the beauty and simplicity found in peaceful moments. The haiku invites readers to appreciate the quiet, often overlooked, harmony present in nature.

This haiku captures a poignant moment of separation between a parent and their child. The 'sunny day' sets a warm and hopeful scene, yet the 'different directions' suggests a divergence in paths, symbolizing growth, independence, or perhaps a bittersweet farewell. The phrase 'my dear only boy' conveys deep affection and a sense of singular importance, highlighting the emotional weight of this moment. The haiku beautifully encapsulates the universal experience of watching a loved one embark on their own journey, blending joy with a touch of melancholy.

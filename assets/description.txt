This haiku presents a contemplative reflection on the nature of thought and the experience of divine mercy. The phrase 'That be a whole thought' suggests a completeness or fullness of understanding, inviting readers to consider a singular, profound idea. The second line, 'That is to be empiric,' brings in the notion of experience, implying that true understanding comes not just from abstract contemplation but from tangible, lived experiences. The final line, 'For His great mercy,' introduces a spiritual dimension, acknowledging a higher power's benevolence and grace. Together, these lines create a meditative exploration of how empirical experiences shape our understanding of mercy and existence.

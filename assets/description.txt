This haiku captures a moment of quiet introspection and the subtle presence of someone who has prepared for an encounter. The phrase 'Close in upon us' suggests an impending moment or realization that is drawing near. 'He had provided himself' indicates that this individual has made necessary preparations, perhaps emotionally or physically, to be present in this moment. Finally, 'In the quiet air' evokes a serene, almost sacred atmosphere where this presence is felt. The haiku beautifully conveys the tension and tranquility of an anticipated meeting or realization, all within the stillness of the surrounding environment.

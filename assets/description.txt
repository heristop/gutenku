This haiku paints a vivid image of a scene laid out before the observer, where 'watery mountains' suggest the undulating waves of the sea or perhaps reflections in a body of water. The phrase 'her destined state' hints at a sense of inevitability or fate, possibly referring to the natural course of life or the future of the landscape itself. The juxtaposition of the serene yet powerful imagery with the concept of destiny evokes a contemplative mood, inviting readers to ponder the interconnectedness of nature and fate.

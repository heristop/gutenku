This haiku captures a moment of ambiguity and introspection at the break of dawn. The poet describes the early morning light as 'indistinct,' suggesting a sense of uncertainty or confusion. The phrase 'I doubted my eyes' indicates a moment of self-doubt or disbelief, as if the poet is questioning the reality of what they are seeing. This haiku beautifully encapsulates the fleeting and often unclear nature of dawn, a time when the world is transitioning from night to day, and everything seems to be in a state of flux. The use of simple yet evocative language allows readers to feel the poet's hesitation and wonder, making the haiku a poignant reflection on the elusive nature of perception and reality.

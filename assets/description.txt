This haiku captures a moment in the life of a walrus, emphasizing its leisurely and observant nature. The imagery of the 'right arm thrown back' suggests a relaxed, almost human-like posture, inviting readers to see the walrus as a contemplative creature. The phrase 'looks about him' indicates a sense of awareness and curiosity, as if the walrus is taking in its surroundings with a thoughtful gaze. The final line, 'as they go along,' implies movement and a journey, perhaps with others, highlighting the communal and exploratory aspects of the walrus's life. This haiku beautifully encapsulates a serene moment in nature, inviting readers to pause and appreciate the simple yet profound existence of the walrus.

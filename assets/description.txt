This haiku captures a moment of clarity and readiness, both literally and metaphorically. The 'mists cleared away' suggests the lifting of confusion or uncertainty, revealing the 'scientific instruments' that symbolize knowledge, tools, and the potential for discovery. The final line, 'And we set to work,' conveys a sense of purpose and action, as if the clearing of the mists has not only revealed the tools but also ignited a drive to explore and understand. This haiku beautifully encapsulates the transition from obscurity to enlightenment, a theme that resonates with the pursuit of knowledge and the human spirit of inquiry.

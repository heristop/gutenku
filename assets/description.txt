This haiku captures a poignant moment of reverence and reflection. The phrase 'Terrific glory' suggests a sense of awe, perhaps evoking the majesty of life or the divine. The 'man beloved of heaven' implies a figure of great significance, possibly a hero, martyr, or a person of virtue who has garnered admiration and respect from both earthly beings and celestial entities. In 'his latest hour,' we are led to contemplate mortality and the culmination of a life well-lived. The juxtaposition of glory with the finality of a life reaching its end invites readers to meditate on the interplay between life, death, and the legacy we leave behind. This haiku encapsulates a moment of beauty amidst the sorrow of loss, celebrating the divine aspect of human existence.

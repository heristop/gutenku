This haiku captures a fleeting moment of connection with nature, where the speaker senses an unseen presence, perhaps the sun or a person, that enhances the warmth and brightness of the day. The first line, 'I must have seen him,' suggests a moment of realization or recognition, while the second line, 'The radiance increasing,' conveys the intensifying light and warmth. The final line, 'The day being warm,' ties the experience to the physical sensation of warmth, creating a vivid and intimate scene. The haiku encapsulates the beauty of a simple, yet profound moment where the external environment and internal perception align harmoniously.

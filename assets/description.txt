This haiku captures a profound sense of solitude, emphasizing the speaker's complete isolation. The phrase 'entirely alone' sets the tone, suggesting a deep introspection or a moment of personal reflection. The 'most solemn manner' implies a seriousness or gravity to this solitude, perhaps indicating a moment of contemplation or realization. The final line, 'for just at that time,' suggests a fleeting, yet significant moment, highlighting the transient nature of such experiences. This haiku beautifully encapsulates the essence of being alone, not just physically, but emotionally and spiritually, in a brief yet impactful moment.

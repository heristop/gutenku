This haiku captures the essence of a person's reflective journey during a summer vacation. The 'response of man' suggests a reaction or contemplation, possibly to the natural world or life's circumstances. As a 'summer vacationist,' the individual is temporarily removed from their routine, allowing space for exploration and self-discovery. The phrase 'to experiment' implies a willingness to try new things, embrace change, or engage in introspection. This haiku beautifully encapsulates the transformative potential of a summer break, where one can pause, reflect, and experiment with new perspectives or experiences.

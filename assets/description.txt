This haiku captures a fleeting moment of observation and transformation. The speaker's gaze shifts away from a person's face, and in that instant, the surrounding light seems to intensify. The warmth of the day complements this increase in radiance, suggesting a harmonious connection between the external environment and the internal experience. The poem evokes a sense of transient beauty and the subtle interplay between human perception and nature.

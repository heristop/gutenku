This haiku captures a moment of transition and departure. The first line, 'The mists cleared away,' sets the scene by describing a natural phenomenon that often symbolizes clarity or revelation. As the mist dissipates, it reveals the next phase of action. The second line, 'In all probability,' introduces a sense of uncertainty or speculation, suggesting that the observer is not entirely sure of what has happened but is making an educated guess. The final line, 'They took to their boats,' concludes the scene with an image of people embarking on a journey, likely by sea. This haiku encapsulates a fleeting moment where nature and human action intersect, leaving the reader to ponder the reasons and destinations behind the departure.

This haiku captures the essence of truth's magnetic pull. The first line, 'They will flock to him,' suggests that people are naturally drawn to someone who embodies truth. The second line, 'He attains truth most nearly,' implies that this individual has a profound understanding or closeness to truth, which sets him apart. The final line, 'Even in good men,' highlights that even those who are already virtuous recognize and are attracted to this deeper level of truth. The haiku reflects on the universal appeal and respect that truth commands, transcending ordinary goodness.

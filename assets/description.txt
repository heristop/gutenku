This haiku captures a moment of simple yet profound beauty on a sunny day. The first line sets the scene with the warmth and brightness of the sun, suggesting a day filled with potential and positivity. The second line, 'In different directions,' evokes a sense of movement and diversity, perhaps indicating people or elements of nature branching out in various paths, each with its own journey. The final line, 'And make us happy,' ties the scene together by highlighting the joy and contentment that arise from this harmonious divergence. The haiku celebrates the beauty of individuality and the happiness found in the freedom to explore one's own path under the unifying light of the sun.

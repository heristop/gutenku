This haiku captures a poignant moment of parting and reflection. The first line, 'I sent you to him,' suggests a transfer or a farewell, possibly indicating a loved one being sent to another person, perhaps in a final or significant way. The second line, 'All was hushed and beautiful,' paints a serene and almost sacred atmosphere, emphasizing the quiet and the beauty of the moment. The final line, 'Look at their faces,' invites the reader to observe the expressions of those involved, hinting at the emotions and stories etched into their features. The haiku, with its brevity, leaves much to the imagination, allowing readers to fill in the gaps with their own experiences and emotions.

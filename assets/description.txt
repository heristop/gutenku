This haiku captures a moment of serene contentment in the life of a hermit, who is deeply moved by a sense of faithful love. The 'calm retreat' symbolizes the hermit's peaceful and solitary lifestyle, which is unexpectedly brightened by a 'laugh of pride.' This laugh suggests a moment of self-realization or a joyful acknowledgment of the simple yet profound beauty in his life. The haiku beautifully juxtaposes the tranquility of solitude with the warmth of love, illustrating how even in isolation, one can find profound joy and pride.

This haiku captures a moment of introspection and yearning. The speaker expresses a desire to understand or reach a certain place or state of being, as indicated by 'Where I want to know.' This quest for knowledge or enlightenment leaves the soul in a state of heightened awareness, as suggested by 'It leaveth my soul awake.' The final line, 'Still stretching thyself,' implies an ongoing journey or effort, suggesting that the pursuit of understanding is a continuous process. The haiku beautifully encapsulates the tension between the desire for knowledge and the perpetual nature of seeking.

This haiku captures a moment of transition, where the dawn is not yet fully formed, leaving the world in a state of ambiguity. The phrase 'as it seemed to me' suggests a personal, subjective experience, emphasizing the observer's perception of the early morning. The 'dawn was still indistinct' conveys a sense of mystery and potential, as the day has not yet revealed its full form. The final line, 'in their interest,' implies that this indistinctness holds a certain allure or curiosity for those observing it. The haiku invites readers to appreciate the beauty and intrigue of moments that are not yet fully realized, encouraging a deeper engagement with the subtle shifts in nature.

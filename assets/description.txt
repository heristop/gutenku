This haiku captures the gradual unveiling of clarity and understanding, much like mists dissipating to reveal a landscape. The first line, 'The mists cleared away,' sets the scene of obscurity lifting, suggesting a transition from confusion to insight. The phrase 'In all probability' introduces an element of uncertainty, acknowledging that clarity often emerges slowly and is not always guaranteed. The final line, 'Slowly but surely,' reinforces the idea of a steady, inevitable progression towards understanding. This haiku beautifully encapsulates the patience and persistence required to achieve clarity in both nature and thought.

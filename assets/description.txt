This haiku captures a moment of intimate awkwardness and sensory confinement. “In that strange costume” suggests a speaker feeling self-conscious—dressed for a role, an occasion, or a version of the self that doesn’t quite fit. The second line, “opening a feather bed,” shifts into a domestic, tactile scene: the bed becomes both literal and symbolic, inviting softness yet also overwhelming in its abundance. By the final line, “pressed on all sides,” the softness turns claustrophobic; the feathers that should comfort instead crowd in, mirroring the speaker’s sense of being hemmed in by expectations, clothing, or circumstance. The poem’s power lies in its physical imagery—feathers, pressure, enclosure—used to express an emotional state: the uneasy tension between comfort and confinement, between play-acting and vulnerability.

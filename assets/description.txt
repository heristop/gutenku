This haiku captures the juxtaposition of fragility and strength through vivid imagery. The phrase 'bound and splintered up' suggests a state of being broken or constrained, yet there is an underlying resilience. The 'strain of gentle music' symbolizes hope and beauty emerging from adversity. Finally, 'smiling through her tears' conveys a poignant image of finding joy and strength even in moments of sorrow. The haiku beautifully encapsulates the theme of enduring hardship with grace and finding solace in the midst of pain.

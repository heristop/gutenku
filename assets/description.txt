This haiku captures a moment of anticipation and arrival. The first line, 'Make haste and come in,' suggests urgency and a welcoming invitation. The second line, 'It was late in October,' sets the scene with a specific time, evoking the crisp, transitional period of autumn. The final line, 'When the boat arrived,' completes the narrative, indicating the culmination of a journey. The imagery of a boat arriving late in October can symbolize the end of a long wait or the beginning of a new chapter as the seasons change.

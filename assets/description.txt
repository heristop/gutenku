This haiku paints a vivid picture of movement and anticipation. The phrase 'These still drive us on' suggests an unseen force or motivation propelling us forward, perhaps the changing seasons or an inner drive. 'All legs go to harvest soon' evokes the image of people or creatures preparing for the harvest, a time of gathering and reaping the rewards of past efforts. The final line, 'With mild stun'sails spread,' introduces a nautical metaphor, likening the journey to a ship with sails unfurled, gently propelled by the wind. This imagery captures a sense of calm determination and readiness for what lies ahead, blending the natural cycle of growth with the human spirit of perseverance.

This haiku captures the essence of aging with grace and warmth. The first line, 'She was older now,' sets the stage by acknowledging the passage of time and the changes it brings. The second line, 'With soft dreamy radiance,' suggests that despite aging, there is a gentle beauty and a serene glow that comes with maturity. The final line, 'And home-made butter,' adds a touch of nostalgia and domesticity, evoking a sense of comfort and tradition. Together, these lines paint a picture of a woman who has embraced her age with dignity and continues to find joy in simple, homely pleasures.

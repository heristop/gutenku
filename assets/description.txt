This haiku captures a moment of quiet introspection amidst the chaos of nature. The first line, 'Pray draw up to it,' invites the reader to come closer, suggesting a sense of intimacy or contemplation. The second line, 'The wind was howling outside,' contrasts this invitation with the wild, untamed force of nature, creating a vivid auditory image. The final line, 'With your permission,' adds a layer of politeness and respect, perhaps indicating a request for consent to share in this moment of reflection. The haiku beautifully balances the internal and external worlds, inviting the reader to find peace within the storm.

This haiku explores the profound nature of love and admiration. The first line, "Whom he fondly loved," establishes a deep emotional connection, suggesting a relationship filled with affection and warmth. The second line, "Her features are beautiful," highlights the physical attributes of the beloved, implying that beauty is not merely skin deep but also a reflection of the love felt towards her. The final line, "All-pervading love," transcends the physical, indicating that this love permeates every aspect of existence, suggesting a spiritual or universal quality to the feelings expressed. Together, the three lines encapsulate a journey from personal admiration to a broader, almost cosmic appreciation of love's power and beauty.

This haiku captures the essence of paradise through the lens of skepticism. The 'paradisal air' suggests an idyllic, almost heavenly atmosphere, inviting readers to imagine a place of ultimate beauty and tranquility. However, the phrase 'as some narrators suppose' introduces doubt, hinting at the subjective nature of such descriptions. The final line, 'it is over-rich,' suggests that this paradise might be too perfect, perhaps overwhelming or even suffocating in its abundance. The haiku invites reflection on the idea that what is often perceived as perfect might carry its own burdens or excesses.

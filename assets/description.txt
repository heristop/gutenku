This haiku captures the essence of duality and power within a single entity. The phrase 'Wedged in one body' suggests a unity or coexistence of two forces within a singular form. The 'second power above' likely refers to a celestial or divine force, possibly the moon or another heavenly body, which complements or contrasts with 'The unwearied sun.' The sun, often symbolizing energy, life, and constancy, is described as tireless, emphasizing its relentless and enduring nature. This haiku invites readers to contemplate the harmonious yet distinct powers that exist within the universe, reflecting on how different forces can coexist within a single entity or space.

This haiku captures the contrast between internal chaos and external tranquility. The first line, 'When she again lived,' suggests a return to a familiar emotional state, hinting at a cycle of recurring feelings. The 'painful state of mind' in the second line conveys a sense of inner struggle or distress. Despite this internal turmoil, the final line, 'All around was calm,' highlights the juxtaposition between her inner world and the serene environment surrounding her. This contrast emphasizes the isolation one can feel when their internal experiences do not align with the external world, a common theme in literature that explores the complexities of human emotion.

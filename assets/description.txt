This haiku captures a moment of introspection and contemplation. The first line, 'During the whole time,' suggests a period of reflection or an ongoing experience. The second line, 'That spoke so much of heaven,' implies that this experience or moment is filled with a sense of divine or transcendent beauty. The final line, 'Tell us what you see,' invites the reader or a companion to share their vision or understanding of this heavenly experience. The haiku, with its brevity, evokes a sense of wonder and encourages the reader to ponder the nature of beauty and perception.

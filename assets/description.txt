This haiku captures a moment of introspection and the passage of time through the lens of honest labor. The first line, 'Honest work above,' suggests a scene where diligent effort is being exerted, possibly under the open sky or in a setting where the work is elevated in importance or location. The second line, 'The radiance increasing,' evokes the image of growing light, which could symbolize the rising sun, the culmination of effort, or an increasing sense of fulfillment. The final line, 'I looked at my watch,' grounds the poem in the present moment, highlighting the human tendency to measure time even amidst the beauty and satisfaction of honest work. This haiku elegantly balances the natural world with human perception, inviting readers to reflect on the relationship between time, effort, and the light of achievement.

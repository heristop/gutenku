This haiku captures a moment of unexpected interaction between a person and a buzzing creature, likely a bee or a similar insect. The first line, 'Seeming lost in thought,' sets a tranquil scene, suggesting the person is deep in contemplation. The second line, 'It first buzzed over my head,' introduces an element of surprise and movement, as the buzzing insect disrupts the person's reverie. The final line, 'All at once she flushed,' indicates a sudden emotional or physical reaction, possibly a blush or a startle, as the person becomes aware of the insect's presence. This haiku beautifully encapsulates the fleeting nature of such encounters and the way they can momentarily jolt us out of our introspection.

This haiku pivots on the unsettling phrase “whose name is legion,” an allusion to the Biblical story in which a single voice speaks for a multitude—suggesting something pervasive, multiplying, and hard to contain. Here, that sense of overwhelming multitude is humorously redirected into the domestic realm: the “legion” becomes the constant accumulation of dirt, germs, or everyday mess that demands “more frequent washing.” The final line—“you would be quite right”—lands as a dry, almost conversational concession, as if the speaker is responding to a complaint or admonition about cleanliness. The poem’s wit lies in its blend of grand, ominous diction with ordinary household advice, turning anxiety about contamination into a resigned acknowledgment: yes, the threat is many, and yes, washing more often is sensible.

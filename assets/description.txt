This haiku captures the essence of paradise as perceived by some narrators, suggesting that the air in such a place is 'over-rich.' The first line, 'Paradisal air,' sets the scene of an idyllic, heavenly environment. The second line, 'As some narrators suppose,' introduces a subjective perspective, hinting that this view of paradise is not universally accepted but rather a narrative construct. The final line, 'It is over-rich,' implies that the abundance or perfection of paradise might be overwhelming or excessive, challenging the idealized notion of paradise as purely blissful. This haiku invites readers to reflect on the complexity of paradise and the subjective nature of its portrayal.

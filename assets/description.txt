This haiku captures the essence of nature's powerful and rejuvenating presence. The phrase 'Bears all before him' suggests a forceful and commanding presence, possibly referring to a natural phenomenon like the wind or a river that clears everything in its path. 'A prosperous signal sent' implies a positive omen or a sign of good fortune, perhaps indicating the arrival of spring or a bountiful season. Finally, 'Fresh with bloom divine' evokes the image of new life and beauty, as flowers blossom and nature renews itself. The haiku beautifully encapsulates the cycle of nature, where destruction leads to renewal and prosperity.

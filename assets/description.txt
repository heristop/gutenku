This haiku captures a moment of profound peace and spiritual fulfillment. The 'aged saint' symbolizes wisdom and enlightenment, having journeyed through life and now returning home, a metaphor for reaching a state of inner tranquility. The image of 'palms together laid' suggests prayer or meditation, indicating a deep connection with the divine or the universe. The phrase 'The power supreme' implies that true strength lies in spiritual enlightenment and inner peace, rather than in physical prowess or material wealth. This haiku beautifully encapsulates the essence of spiritual completion and the serene power that comes with it.

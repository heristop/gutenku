This haiku captures a profound moment of reflection and reward, suggesting a connection between nature and personal fate. The phrase 'Thus he rewards you' implies a sense of divine or cosmic justice, hinting at the idea that one's actions or virtues are acknowledged in a broader, possibly spiritual context. The 'watery mountains' evoke imagery of serene yet powerful landscapes, perhaps symbolizing the challenges and beauty of life. This juxtaposition suggests that one’s destined state, or ultimate purpose, is shaped by both the tranquil and tumultuous aspects of existence. The haiku invites readers to contemplate how their journeys through life, marked by various experiences, lead toward a predetermined path shaped by nature and fate.

This haiku captures a profound sense of tranquility that follows a moment of certainty. The first line, 'There is to be had,' suggests the presence of something attainable, perhaps a state of mind or a particular feeling. The second line, 'In an assured kind of way,' emphasizes the confidence and certainty with which this state is achieved. Finally, 'Then a great quiet' encapsulates the serene aftermath of this assuredness, where peace and calm prevail. The haiku beautifully illustrates the journey from seeking to finding, and ultimately, to resting in quietude.

This haiku captures the ethereal and transcendent nature of love. The 'clear sparks' symbolize the pure and illuminating moments of affection that ignite the soul. The 'saintly creatures flying' evoke a sense of divine or angelic presence, suggesting that love elevates and transcends the mundane. The final line, 'Of himself he guides,' implies a self-directed journey, where love serves as both the compass and the destination. This haiku beautifully encapsulates the idea that love is a guiding force, leading one towards a higher, more enlightened state of being.

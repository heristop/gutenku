This haiku captures the essence of finding peace and tranquility through certainty. The first line, 'There is to be had,' suggests the availability or presence of something valuable or meaningful. The second line, 'In an assured kind of way,' implies that this presence is accompanied by a sense of confidence or certainty. Finally, 'Then a great quiet' signifies the profound silence or calm that follows this assurance. The poem beautifully encapsulates the idea that true peace often comes from a place of inner certainty and understanding, leading to a serene and quiet state of being.

This haiku captures a moment of profound connection between the present and the past. The phrase 'Who came up to him' suggests an encounter, perhaps with a person or a memory, that approaches the subject with 'broad waves of melody.' This imagery evokes a sense of music or harmony, symbolizing the emotional resonance and depth of the experience. The final line, 'Living the old life,' implies a return or a reflection on past experiences, suggesting that the melody brings the subject back to a previous state of being or a cherished memory. The haiku beautifully encapsulates the idea of how certain encounters or memories can transport us back in time, allowing us to relive moments that have shaped us.

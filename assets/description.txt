This haiku captures a moment of brief interaction, where the speaker observes a group or individuals approaching. The phrase 'Very pleasant was their day' suggests that these individuals carry an aura of contentment and joy, which is palpable even from a distance. The final line, 'However perfect,' introduces a subtle twist, implying that despite the apparent perfection of their day, there might be an underlying complexity or imperfection. This haiku invites readers to reflect on the transient nature of encounters and the layers of emotion that can exist beneath the surface of seemingly perfect moments.

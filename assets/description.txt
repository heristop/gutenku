This haiku seems to reflect on the enduring happiness of a character named Nebridius. The first line, 'Whatever that be,' suggests a sense of acceptance or resignation to the circumstances or the essence of existence. It implies that regardless of what life is or what it brings, there is a constant element. 'There lives my Nebridius' introduces a personal connection to Nebridius, indicating that this character holds a significant place in the speaker's life or thoughts. Nebridius could be a person, a pet, or even a personification of an idea or emotion that the speaker cherishes. The final line, 'Endlessly happy,' conveys a state of perpetual joy, suggesting that Nebridius exists in a state of bliss that is unaffected by the changing nature of 'whatever that be.' The haiku captures a snapshot of contentment and peace, perhaps highlighting the idea that true happiness is internal and not dependent on external factors.

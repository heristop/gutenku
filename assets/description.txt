This haiku captures a fleeting moment of uncertainty and solitude. The speaker reflects on a possible encounter with someone in a deserted place, emphasizing the isolation of the scene. The warmth of the day adds a layer of lethargy and stillness, enhancing the sense of quiet and introspection. The ambiguity of 'I must have seen him' suggests a moment of doubt or a memory that is not entirely clear, which adds to the poem's contemplative mood.

This haiku captures the fleeting essence of human interaction with nature during a summer vacation. The 'response of man' suggests a reaction or an engagement, perhaps with the natural world or a new experience. The 'summer vacationist' is a transient figure, someone who steps out of their routine to explore and enjoy the warmth and freedom of summer. 'To experiment' implies a sense of curiosity and willingness to try new things, reflecting the adventurous spirit that often accompanies a break from daily life. The haiku, in its brevity, encapsulates the transient yet impactful moments of discovery and connection that define a summer getaway.

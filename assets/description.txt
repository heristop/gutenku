This haiku captures a fleeting moment of introspection interrupted by a sudden, unexpected event. The first line, "Seeming lost in thought," sets the scene, suggesting a person deeply engrossed in their own reflections, perhaps contemplating life or emotions. The second line introduces a buzzing sound, an unexpected interruption that draws attention away from contemplation. The use of the word 'buzzed' adds a sense of urgency and surprise, as if the tranquility of thought is shattered by this sudden noise. The final line, "All at once she flushed," conveys a visceral reaction, indicating that the interruption has evoked a strong emotional response, likely embarrassment or surprise. The haiku encapsulates the interplay between internal thought and external stimuli, illustrating how quickly one's focus can shift in the face of unexpected moments.

This haiku captures a fleeting moment of recognition and warmth. The speaker reflects on having seen someone, perhaps a person of significance, whose presence seems to amplify the surrounding light. The 'radiance increasing' suggests an emotional or spiritual illumination, as if the mere sight of this individual brightens the world. The mention of 'the day being warm' ties the experience to a specific, tangible sensation, grounding the ethereal moment in the physical world. This haiku beautifully encapsulates how a brief encounter can leave a lasting impression, enhancing both the internal and external environment.

This haiku captures the juxtaposition between internal chaos and external tranquility. The first line, 'When she again lived,' suggests a return to a familiar state of being, possibly one of emotional distress or mental struggle. The phrase 'In this painful state of mind' highlights the internal conflict or suffering the subject is experiencing. Despite this inner turmoil, the final line, 'All around was calm,' paints a picture of serene surroundings, emphasizing the contrast between the subject's mental state and the peaceful environment. This haiku beautifully illustrates the common human experience of feeling unsettled internally while the world outside remains undisturbed.

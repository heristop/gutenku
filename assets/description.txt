This haiku presents a serene yet humorous juxtaposition of choices. The first line, 'Which to attend to,' introduces a moment of contemplation, suggesting a decision between two appealing options. The second line, 'A beautifully calm race,' evokes an image of a peaceful, perhaps leisurely competition, where the focus is on the beauty of the experience rather than the outcome. The final line, 'Taking up biscuits,' adds a whimsical twist, contrasting the calmness of the race with the simple pleasure of enjoying biscuits. This haiku captures the essence of finding beauty and joy in everyday moments, highlighting the gentle humor in life's small decisions.

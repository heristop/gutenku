This haiku captures the essence of time and memory. The phrase 'In the course of time' suggests the passage of time, while 'As already related' implies a story or history that has been told before. The final line, 'Transparent amber,' serves as a metaphor for memories preserved in their purest form, much like insects trapped in amber. The haiku beautifully encapsulates the idea that while time moves forward, certain moments remain crystal clear and unchanging, preserved in the 'amber' of our minds.

This haiku captures the essence of anticipation and the subsequent calm that follows fulfillment. The first line, 'There is to be had,' suggests the presence of something attainable, a promise or a goal within reach. The second line, 'In an assured kind of way,' conveys a sense of confidence and certainty in achieving this promise. It speaks to the assurance that comes with knowing that what is sought is not only possible but inevitable. The final line, 'Then a great quiet,' reflects the profound peace and tranquility that follows once the goal is achieved. This quiet is not just the absence of noise but a deep, satisfying silence that comes from fulfillment and contentment. The haiku beautifully encapsulates the journey from anticipation to assurance, culminating in a serene stillness.

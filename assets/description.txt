This haiku captures the serene and rejuvenating essence of a morning by the sea. The first line, 'They praised the morning,' suggests a collective appreciation for the new day, perhaps by people or nature itself. The second line, 'The sea-air always does good,' highlights the invigorating and healing qualities of the ocean breeze, which is often associated with clarity and renewal. The final line, 'He sent in letters,' introduces a personal touch, suggesting communication or connection, possibly through messages carried by the sea or inspired by the tranquil setting. This haiku beautifully intertwines nature's restorative power with human interaction, evoking a sense of peace and reflection.

This haiku captures a moment of introspection and nostalgia. The speaker is looking back at a past time or place, now illuminated by the 'brilliant light' of memory. The use of 'sadly' suggests a sense of longing or regret, perhaps for something lost or unattainable. The final line, 'That was a good place,' affirms the value and positivity of the past experience, contrasting with the present emotion. The haiku encapsulates the bittersweet nature of reminiscing, where the beauty of the memory is tinged with the sadness of its passing.

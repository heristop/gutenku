This haiku captures a moment of serene yet profound emotion. The 'faithful love' suggests a deep, unwavering affection that stirs the hermit, a figure typically associated with solitude and contemplation. Despite his isolated lifestyle, the hermit experiences a 'laugh of pride,' indicating a moment of joy and self-satisfaction. This juxtaposition of solitude and joy highlights the idea that true contentment and pride can be found within oneself, even in the absence of others. The haiku beautifully conveys the harmony between inner peace and the quiet, yet powerful, emotions that can arise from within.

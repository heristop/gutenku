This haiku captures a moment of ethereal beauty and unexpected communication. The phrase 'Advanced to meet him' suggests an approach or a meeting, perhaps between two entities or forces. Instead of a traditional bugle call, which often signals an announcement or a call to action, the poet uses the imagery of something that 'Flit through the heavens.' This evokes a sense of lightness and transcendence, as if the message or the meeting is conveyed through the delicate and fleeting movement of celestial bodies or perhaps even birds. The haiku invites readers to imagine a scene where communication transcends the ordinary, reaching into the realm of the divine or the cosmic.

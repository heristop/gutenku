This haiku captures a moment of submission and pride through the imagery of nature. 'The Greek obeys him' suggests a figure of authority or influence, possibly a leader or a deity, to whom the Greek shows deference. The 'snowy flowerets fair' symbolize purity and beauty, perhaps representing the Greek's actions or intentions. The final line, 'Proud of his deed,' indicates a sense of accomplishment or honor in this act of obedience. The haiku juxtaposes the simplicity and elegance of nature with complex human emotions, highlighting themes of duty, pride, and the beauty found in submission.

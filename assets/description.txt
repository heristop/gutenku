This haiku captures a poignant moment of reflection and loss. The imagery of 'The tide being out' suggests a sense of emptiness or absence, as if something once vibrant and full has receded. The phrase 'As having belonged to you' implies a personal connection to this loss, hinting at a past relationship or cherished memory that has now faded. Finally, 'In her folded hands' evokes a sense of reverence and stillness, as if the memory or the essence of what was lost is being gently held and preserved. The haiku beautifully encapsulates the transient nature of life and the delicate way we hold onto what remains.

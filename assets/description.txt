This haiku captures a profound moment of tranquility that follows a sense of certainty. The first line, 'There is to be had,' suggests the presence of something attainable, something within reach. The second line, 'In an assured kind of way,' implies that this attainment comes with confidence and certainty, without doubt or hesitation. Finally, the third line, 'Then a great quiet,' reveals the ultimate reward of this assuredness: a deep, encompassing silence that brings peace and calm. The haiku beautifully encapsulates the journey from seeking and finding to the serene stillness that follows fulfillment.

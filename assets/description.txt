This haiku captures a moment of serene reflection, where the presence of Jack, a familiar companion, is evoked. The first line, 'There is to be had,' suggests the availability of something intangible, perhaps a shared experience or a moment of connection. The second line, 'In which Jack often joined us,' introduces a sense of camaraderie and nostalgia, as Jack's presence is a recurring element in these shared moments. The final line, 'Then a great quiet,' signifies the transition from companionship to a profound silence, emphasizing the peace and tranquility that follows. This haiku beautifully encapsulates the fleeting nature of shared experiences and the quietude that often follows them.

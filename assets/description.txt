This haiku captures a moment of urgency and nostalgia. The speaker urges someone to 'make haste and come in,' suggesting a sense of immediacy and perhaps a welcoming gesture. The mention of 'late in October' evokes the transition from autumn to winter, a time often associated with change and reflection. 'In my native place' adds a personal touch, grounding the scene in a location filled with personal history and sentiment. The haiku beautifully encapsulates the fleeting nature of time and the longing for connection in a familiar setting.

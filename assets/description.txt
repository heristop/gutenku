This haiku captures a swift transformation in the natural world, moving from calm to imminent upheaval. The opening image, “The silent ocean,” establishes a hush and stillness—an almost reverent pause before change. In the second line, the sunrise appears “red and fiery,” suggesting both beauty and forewarning; the colour red can imply heat, intensity, or even danger, as though the day begins with a burning omen on the horizon. The final line, “With a rising gale,” introduces motion and tension, breaking the earlier silence and hinting at an approaching storm. Together, the poem contrasts tranquillity with turbulence, using sensory imagery (soundless sea, blazing light, strengthening wind) to show how quickly nature’s mood can shift.

This haiku captures the essence of transformation and the tranquility that follows. The opening line, 'There is to be had,' suggests the potential or opportunity that exists in the world. The second line, 'Made over so many times,' speaks to the process of change and reinvention, hinting at the cycles of life and the continuous evolution of nature and self. Finally, 'Then a great quiet' conveys the peace and stillness that often follow significant transformation, a moment of reflection and calm after the storm of change. The haiku beautifully encapsulates the journey from potential through transformation to tranquility, inviting readers to appreciate the quietude that comes after embracing change.

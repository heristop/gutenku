This haiku playfully meditates on how identity is carried in language. By likening “wee” (the small, the humble, perhaps even the pronoun “we”) to “proper names,” it suggests that even the tiniest beings possess a distinct essence—something singular and recognisable. The archaic spelling (“use to doe”) lends a historical, almost proverbial tone, as if the poem is quoting an old observation about naming and nature. The final line, “bee upon the Earth,” grounds the thought in the physical world: to be (and to “bee”) is to occupy a place in creation, however small. The pun on “bee/be” reinforces the idea that existence and identity are intertwined—language does not merely label life; it echoes its presence.

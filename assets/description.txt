This haiku captures a fleeting moment of refined grace. The phrase 'As a second thought' suggests an afterthought or a moment of reflection, setting a contemplative tone. The image of smoke curling upward evokes a sense of transience and delicacy, as smoke is both ethereal and temporary. The 'refined-looking man' adds a human element, suggesting sophistication and poise. Together, these elements create a vivid snapshot of a moment that is both delicate and dignified, inviting readers to pause and appreciate the subtle beauty in everyday occurrences.

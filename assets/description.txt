This haiku captures a moment of delicate interaction between nature and the observer. The image of a flower quivering with its back turned suggests a sense of anticipation or longing. It evokes the idea that nature is alive and inviting, almost as if the flower is extending an invitation to the observer to return and engage with its beauty. The phrase 'Come and see me soon' adds a personal touch, transforming the flower into a character with its own voice, urging the reader to reconnect with the natural world.

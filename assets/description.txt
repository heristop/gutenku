This haiku captures the fleeting nature of paradise, evoking a sense of impermanence and introspection. The 'paradisal air' suggests an idyllic, almost heavenly atmosphere, inviting readers to imagine a perfect moment or place. However, the phrase 'as some narrators suppose' introduces a layer of skepticism or doubt, hinting that this paradise might be subjective or illusory. The concluding line, 'It is all over,' delivers a poignant realization that such moments of perfection are transient, leaving behind a sense of nostalgia or loss. The haiku invites readers to reflect on the transient beauty of life and the stories we tell ourselves about perfection.

This haiku captures a moment of quiet observation and longing. The image of someone turning their back suggests a sense of departure or distance, yet the flower's quiver introduces a sense of life and anticipation. The final line, 'Come and see me soon,' conveys a yearning for connection and reunion. The poem beautifully encapsulates the tension between absence and presence, highlighting the delicate interplay between nature and human emotion.

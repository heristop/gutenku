This haiku speaks to the theme of return and belonging. The first line, 'It comes back to one,' suggests a cyclical journey or a recurring thought, emphasizing the inevitability of return. The second line, 'The harbour is well chosen,' implies a deliberate decision in selecting this particular place of return, indicating that it holds significance. The word 'harbour' conveys safety and shelter, suggesting that the place of return offers comfort or respite. The final line, 'Befitting a port,' reinforces the idea that the chosen harbor is appropriate for its purpose, which is to welcome back those who have ventured out. The haiku as a whole captures the essence of finding a place where one fits perfectly, akin to a ship that finds its rightful port after a long voyage.

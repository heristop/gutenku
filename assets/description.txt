This haiku captures a profound sense of tranquility that follows a moment of certainty. The first line, 'There is to be had,' suggests the presence of something attainable, perhaps a goal or a state of mind. The second line, 'In an assured kind of way,' emphasizes the confidence and certainty in achieving this state. Finally, 'Then a great quiet' conveys the deep peace and stillness that ensues once this assured state is reached. The haiku beautifully encapsulates the journey from desire to fulfillment, culminating in serene quietude.

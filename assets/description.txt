This haiku captures a slow, sun-soaked day of simple companionship: two people lying still, fishing, and talking. The plain, conversational voice (“We laid there all day”) creates a relaxed, unhurried rhythm, while the shared actions—catching fish and talking—suggest both survival and friendship, body and mind fed at once. The colloquial phrasing (“catched,” “de good book”) gives the speaker a distinct, informal identity and grounds the scene in everyday life rather than polished poetry. The final line introduces a gentle moral or spiritual frame: “the good book” (likely the Bible) implies that this humble leisure—rest, fellowship, and honest work—fits a larger code of living. Overall, the haiku blends nature, community, and faith, turning an ordinary day by the water into a quiet lesson about contentment and meaning.

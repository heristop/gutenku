This haiku captures a moment of quiet anticipation and mystery. The first line, 'Who could come to-night,' sets a tone of curiosity and perhaps a hint of anxiety, as the speaker wonders about an unexpected visitor. The second line, 'The smoke still curled upward,' paints a vivid image of a recently extinguished fire, suggesting that the night is still young and the atmosphere is calm yet filled with potential. The final line, 'He gives no trouble,' brings a sense of relief and tranquility, indicating that the anticipated visitor is benign and causes no disturbance. The haiku masterfully uses minimal words to evoke a rich scene and a range of emotions, from curiosity to peace.

This haiku captures the paradox of inner turmoil juxtaposed with external calm. The first line, 'When she again lived,' suggests a return to a familiar state of being, possibly hinting at a recurring emotional struggle. The second line, 'In this painful state of mind,' delves deeper into her internal suffering, emphasizing the intensity of her emotional pain. However, the final line, 'All around was calm,' contrasts sharply with her inner chaos, highlighting the dissonance between her internal experience and the external world. This juxtaposition underscores the theme that personal anguish often goes unnoticed in the face of outward tranquility.

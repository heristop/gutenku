This haiku moves in widening circles: it begins with the solidity of “Mountains,” shifts to the vast openness of “the sea,” and then places a single “Person” within the immeasurable scale of “the universe.” The progression suggests a journey from the tangible landscape to cosmic awareness, where human life feels both small and meaningfully situated. The final line, “The sun from rising,” introduces dawn as a symbol of renewal and perspective—light arriving to reveal the world anew. Overall, the poem balances grandeur and humility, implying that standing between mountain and ocean can awaken a quiet recognition of one’s place in the larger order of existence.

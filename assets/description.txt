This haiku captures the essence of finding peace through certainty. The first line, 'There is to be had,' suggests the availability of something valuable. The second line, 'In an assured kind of way,' implies that this value is obtained through confidence and assurance. Finally, 'Then a great quiet' signifies the ultimate reward: a profound sense of tranquility. The poem beautifully illustrates how inner peace can be achieved through a sense of certainty and assurance, leading to a serene state of mind.

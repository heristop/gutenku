This haiku transports us to a mystical realm where countless entities, perhaps spirits or celestial beings, exist in vast numbers. The phrase 'in another world' sets the stage for a journey beyond our reality. 'In interminable hosts' suggests an infinite multitude, emphasizing the sheer number and omnipresence of these beings. Finally, 'glancing at us all' implies a sense of watchfulness or curiosity from these otherworldly entities, as if they are silently observing our actions and existence from their distant plane. The haiku evokes a sense of wonder and the uncanny, making us ponder the unseen dimensions that might coexist with our own.

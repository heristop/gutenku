This haiku captures a small paradox: as something “retreats backward” (suggesting the day pulling away, the sun lowering, or even a person stepping back), “the radiance” does not fade but intensifies. The second line turns retreat into revelation—distance creates clarity, and the light seems stronger precisely because it is being noticed more keenly. The final line, “The day being warm,” grounds the moment in sensory comfort, suggesting late-afternoon or early-evening heat that lingers even as the sun withdraws. Overall, the poem balances motion and stillness, implying that endings can be luminous, and that warmth—literal or emotional—can remain even as something recedes.

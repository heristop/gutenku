This haiku captures a moment of quiet observation and introspection. The image of a flower quivering with its back turned suggests a delicate, almost secretive interaction with the world. The flower, personified, seems to respond to the presence of the observer, highlighting the subtle connection between nature and human perception. The final line, 'As you have to dress,' introduces a human element, suggesting a parallel between the natural world and daily human rituals. It implies a sense of vulnerability and the necessity of preparing oneself to face the world, much like the flower must endure the elements. This haiku beautifully intertwines the simplicity of nature with the complexity of human experience.

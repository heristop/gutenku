This haiku captures the stark contrast between internal chaos and external tranquility. The first line, 'When she again lived,' suggests a return to a familiar state of being, possibly hinting at a recurring emotional struggle. The second line, 'In this painful state of mind,' explicitly states the nature of her inner turmoil, emphasizing the depth of her emotional pain. The final line, 'All around was calm,' juxtaposes her inner distress with the serene environment surrounding her. This contrast highlights the isolation and loneliness that often accompany personal suffering, as the world outside remains indifferent to her internal battles.

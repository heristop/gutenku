This haiku captures a moment of revelation and transformation. The initial line, 'The mists cleared away,' sets the scene of obscurity giving way to clarity. It suggests a transition from confusion or uncertainty to understanding or realization. The second line, 'In all probability,' introduces an element of expectation or anticipation, hinting at the inevitability of what is to come. The final line, 'Huge masses rose in front,' delivers the culmination of this transformation, as something grand and imposing emerges from the mist. This could symbolize the unveiling of truth, the discovery of something significant, or the confrontation with a formidable challenge. The haiku's brevity and imagery invite readers to reflect on moments in their own lives where clarity has emerged from confusion.

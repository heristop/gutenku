This haiku captures a moment of introspection and realization. The first line, 'I must go in now,' suggests a sudden awareness or decision to retreat inward, possibly for self-reflection or to escape an external situation. The second line, 'A very long time elapsed,' indicates that the speaker has been in a state of contemplation or distraction for an extended period. The final line, 'Looking on the ground,' evokes an image of someone lost in thought, perhaps staring at the earth in a meditative or sorrowful manner. Together, these lines convey a sense of time passing unnoticed while the speaker is absorbed in their own thoughts, ultimately leading to a moment of clarity or decision to return to themselves or their responsibilities.

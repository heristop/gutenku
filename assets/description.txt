This haiku captures the juxtaposition between internal emotional struggle and external tranquility. The first line, 'When she again lived,' suggests a return to a familiar state of being, indicating that the subject has experienced this emotional turmoil before. The second line, 'In this painful state of mind,' highlights the intensity of her internal conflict, suggesting feelings of distress or sorrow. Despite this inner chaos, the final line, 'All around was calm,' paints a picture of serene surroundings, emphasizing the contrast between her mental state and the peaceful environment. This haiku reflects on the human experience of feeling isolated in one's emotions, even when the world outside remains undisturbed.

This haiku captures a moment of unexpected interaction between nature and human presence. The poem begins with a sense of introspection, as the speaker seems lost in thought. This tranquility is interrupted by the buzzing of an insect, likely a bee, which hovers above the speaker's head. The suddenness of this encounter is emphasized by the phrase 'all at once,' suggesting a swift shift from contemplation to awareness. The final line, 'she flushed,' could refer to the speaker's reaction of surprise or embarrassment, or perhaps the bee's quick departure. This haiku beautifully encapsulates the fleeting yet impactful moments when the natural world intrudes upon human introspection, reminding us of our connection to the environment.

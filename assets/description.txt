This haiku sketches a stark moral contrast in three swift strokes. The opening line, “his part was finished,” suggests an ending that is both practical and ominous—someone has completed a task and is ready to step away, implying detachment or finality. The second line, “The workman was horrible,” sharpens the tone into judgement: the “workman” becomes a figure of cruelty or corruption, and the blunt adjective refuses nuance, as if the speaker cannot soften what has been witnessed. The final line, “Cosette was a light,” pivots into tenderness and symbolism. “Light” frames Cosette as innocence, hope, or salvation—something pure that exposes the workman’s ugliness by contrast. Read together, the poem compresses a whole narrative arc: brutal labor or wrongdoing, a cold completion, and then the sudden, humanizing presence of goodness that survives despite it.

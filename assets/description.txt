This haiku traces a quiet chain of influence in the natural world, moving from sky to sea to weather. “The moon to the sun” suggests a cosmic relationship—two governing lights whose pull and heat shape life on Earth. The second line, “Stirring up the deep waters,” evokes the moon’s tidal force and the unseen energies that churn beneath a calm surface, hinting at emotional depth as well as physical motion. In “Making the clouds fall,” the poem completes its cycle: disturbed waters and warmed air rise into cloud, then return as rain—an image of release, consequence, and renewal. The language is simple but expansive, turning a brief observation into a meditation on interconnectedness, where even distant bodies set earthly change in motion.

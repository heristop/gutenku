This haiku captures the ethereal beauty and divine radiance of a scene that seems almost otherworldly. The phrase 'Like heaven itself' sets a celestial tone, suggesting a vision of paradise. 'In glory's light arrayed' evokes an image bathed in magnificent, almost sacred light, enhancing the sense of awe and reverence. The final line, 'Most eloquent,' implies that this vision speaks volumes without uttering a single word, its beauty and grandeur communicating profound emotions and thoughts. The haiku, in its brevity, encapsulates a moment of sublime beauty that transcends ordinary experience.

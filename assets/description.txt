This haiku captures a moment of transition and reflection. The first line, 'As he turned to us,' suggests a pivotal moment where attention shifts, perhaps indicating a significant change or realization. The second line, 'We could hear the rising wind,' uses auditory imagery to evoke a sense of impending change or turmoil, as wind often symbolizes movement and transformation. The final line, 'And now looking back,' implies a retrospective view, suggesting that the speaker is reflecting on past events with the wisdom of hindsight. Together, these lines create a poignant snapshot of a moment where the past and future converge, filled with both uncertainty and clarity.

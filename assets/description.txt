This haiku captures a poignant moment of reflection and urgency. The opening line, 'Have mercy on us,' suggests a plea for compassion or forgiveness, possibly from a higher power or from nature itself. The second line, 'The end is not far off now,' introduces a sense of impending conclusion or change, evoking feelings of anxiety or acceptance of an inevitable fate. The final line, 'To pick a flower,' juxtaposes the looming end with a simple, yet profound act of beauty and life. This act of picking a flower can symbolize the desire to cherish fleeting moments of beauty and life even as one faces the end. The haiku, therefore, encapsulates a complex interplay between despair and hope, urging readers to find grace and beauty in the present moment despite the uncertainty of the future.

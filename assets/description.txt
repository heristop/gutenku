This haiku presents a serene yet whimsical scene, where the speaker is faced with a choice between two appealing activities. The first line, 'Which to attend to,' introduces a moment of decision, suggesting a gentle conflict or a choice between two equally enticing options. The second line, 'A beautifully calm race,' evokes an image of a peaceful competition, perhaps metaphorical, where the usual tension of a race is replaced by tranquility. This juxtaposition of calmness with the concept of a race creates an intriguing paradox. The final line, 'Taking up biscuits,' adds a touch of humor and domesticity, grounding the haiku in a simple, everyday pleasure. The haiku as a whole captures the essence of finding beauty and calm in life's small choices and moments, blending the mundane with the poetic.

This haiku captures a moment of transition from obscurity to clarity, both literally and metaphorically. The 'mists cleared away' suggests the lifting of fog, symbolizing the dissipation of confusion or uncertainty. The 'scientific instruments' become visible, representing knowledge, precision, and the tools of discovery. The phrase 'And we set to work' conveys a sense of purpose and readiness to engage in exploration or problem-solving. This haiku beautifully encapsulates the spirit of scientific inquiry and the excitement of embarking on a journey of understanding once obstacles are removed.

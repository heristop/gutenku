This haiku captures the essence of transformation and the tranquility that follows. The first line, 'There is to be had,' suggests the presence of something valuable or significant. The second line, 'Made over so many times,' implies a process of change or repetition, hinting at the cycles of life or the refinement of an idea or object. Finally, 'Then a great quiet' signifies the profound peace or stillness that comes after these transformations. The poem beautifully encapsulates the journey from activity and change to a serene and contemplative state, inviting readers to reflect on the calm that follows life's myriad experiences.

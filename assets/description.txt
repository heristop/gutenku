This haiku captures a fleeting encounter that is both unexpected and delightful. The speaker observes a group or individuals approaching, and notes the pleasantness of their day. The phrase 'However perfect' suggests a sense of completeness or contentment in the moment, as if the encounter itself adds a layer of perfection to an already pleasant day. The haiku invites readers to appreciate the beauty in spontaneous interactions and the simple joy they can bring.

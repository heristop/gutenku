This haiku captures a moment of transition and revelation. The imagery of 'mists cleared away' suggests a lifting of confusion or uncertainty, often associated with the fog of morning. The phrase 'in all probability' introduces an element of uncertainty or anticipation, hinting at the natural unpredictability of life. Finally, 'in the evening' grounds the poem in a specific time, suggesting that clarity and understanding often come with the day's end, as experiences and thoughts settle. The haiku beautifully encapsulates the theme of clarity emerging from obscurity, both literally and metaphorically.

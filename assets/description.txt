This haiku captures a journey from anticipation to serenity. The first line, 'There is to be had,' suggests the presence of something desirable or awaited. It sets the stage for a sense of expectation. The second line, 'In an assured kind of way,' conveys confidence and certainty, implying that what is to come is both inevitable and reliable. Finally, the third line, 'Then a great quiet,' delivers the resolutionâ€”a profound peace or silence that follows the fulfillment of the initial promise. The haiku beautifully encapsulates the transition from anticipation to fulfillment, culminating in a serene and contemplative state.

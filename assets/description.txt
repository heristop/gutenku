This haiku captures a moment in the life of a walrus, painting a vivid picture with minimal words. The first line, 'His right arm thrown back,' suggests a sense of movement and perhaps a casual, almost human-like gesture. The second line, 'The walrus looks about him,' gives us a glimpse into the walrus's awareness and curiosity about his surroundings. The final line, 'As they go along,' implies a journey, possibly with others, highlighting the communal aspect of the walrus's life. The haiku encapsulates a fleeting yet profound moment, inviting readers to ponder the simplicity and depth of animal existence.

This haiku captures a poignant moment of vulnerability and beauty. The 'glorious eyes' suggest a sense of admiration and allure, yet they are 'bedewed' with a tear, indicating sorrow or distress. The phrase 'a helpless captive' evokes a sense of entrapment, perhaps emotional or situational, highlighting the contrast between the subject's inherent beauty and their current state of helplessness. The imagery is powerful, conveying deep emotion in just a few words.

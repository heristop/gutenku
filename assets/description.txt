This haiku captures a moment of serene confidence and the tranquility that follows. The first line, 'There is to be had,' suggests the presence of something attainable, perhaps a goal or a state of mind. The second line, 'In an assured kind of way,' implies that this attainment comes with a sense of certainty and confidence. Finally, 'Then a great quiet' encapsulates the peace and stillness that ensues once this assured state is reached. The haiku beautifully illustrates the journey from aspiration to calm fulfillment, emphasizing the quietude that accompanies true assurance.

This haiku captures a moment of harmony between humanity and nature. 'The Greek obeys him' suggests a figure, perhaps a gardener or a farmer, who respects and follows the natural order or the guidance of a higher power. 'In snowy flowerets fair' paints a vivid image of delicate, white blossoms, symbolizing purity and the beauty of nature's creations. The final line, 'Proud of his deed,' reflects a sense of accomplishment and pride in nurturing or cultivating these flowers. The haiku beautifully encapsulates the theme of human reverence for nature and the satisfaction derived from working in tandem with it.

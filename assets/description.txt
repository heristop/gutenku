This haiku explores the theme of idealized love and its potential downfall. The 'celestial love' suggests a pure, heavenly affection that aims to fulfill every desire of the beloved. However, the poem takes a dark turn with the phrase 'to corruption turn,' indicating that even the most divine intentions can lead to ruin. This transformation from purity to corruption serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of unchecked desires and the fragility of idealized love.

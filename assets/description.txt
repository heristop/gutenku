This haiku captures a moment of introspection and the appreciation of beauty beyond words. The first line, 'I don't want words,' suggests a desire for an experience or understanding that transcends verbal expression. The second line, 'He asked me to study it,' introduces an external prompt, perhaps from a teacher or mentor, urging the speaker to engage with something deeply. The final line, 'It's beautiful,' reveals the outcome of this engagementâ€”a realization of beauty that doesn't need to be articulated. The haiku emphasizes the power of silent observation and the profound impact of personal discovery.

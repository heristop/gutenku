This haiku captures the theme of returning to one's roots or inner sanctuary. The first line, 'I entice thee back,' suggests a call or longing for someone or something to return. The second line, 'Again came home to his cave,' evokes the image of a person or creature retreating to a place of comfort and safety, perhaps after a journey or period of absence. The final line, 'To our eyes and hearts,' implies that this return is not only a physical journey but also an emotional one, resonating deeply with those who witness it. The haiku beautifully encapsulates the cyclical nature of departure and return, and the profound impact it has on both the traveler and those awaiting their return.

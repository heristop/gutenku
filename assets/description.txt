This haiku captures a juxtaposition of imagery that evokes a sense of nostalgia and distance. The phrase 'In some glad May-time' suggests a time of joy and renewal, typically associated with spring, when life flourishes and nature awakens. However, the following line, 'They seemed pole-like asunder,' introduces a stark contrast, indicating separation and isolation, perhaps reflecting on lost connections or the vastness of the ocean. The final line, 'In some whaling-ships,' grounds the poem in a specific historical and cultural context, evoking the harsh realities of whaling and the human experience intertwined with the sea. Overall, the haiku presents a poignant reflection on the relationship between nature, human endeavors, and the bittersweet nature of memory.

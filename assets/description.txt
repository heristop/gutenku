This haiku captures a fleeting moment of introspective emotion, where the subject's affection is subtly revealed through a 'pensive smile.' The first line, 'That she should love him,' sets the stage for a revelation of unexpected or perhaps unspoken love. The second line, 'A pensive smile in her eyes,' suggests a depth of feeling and contemplation, as if she is lost in thought about her affection. The final line, 'Please remember that,' serves as a gentle reminder or plea, emphasizing the importance of this moment and the emotions it carries. The haiku beautifully encapsulates the complexity of love and the significance of small, yet profound, expressions of emotion.

This haiku captures a tender moment poised between distance and intimacy. The first line, “just as the moon rose,” sets a quiet, luminous scene: moonrise often signals transition, calm, and a widening emotional horizon. In the second line—“write you very soon again”—the speaker shifts from landscape to longing, turning the natural image into a cue for communication, as if the moon’s appearance prompts the impulse to reach out. The final line, “coming close to me,” resolves the poem with a gentle movement inward: closeness may be literal (a reunion) or emotional (the nearness created by writing). Overall, the haiku suggests that small changes in the world—like the moon lifting into view—can awaken hope, connection, and the promise of return.

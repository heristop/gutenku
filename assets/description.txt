This haiku presents a quiet, unsettling scene shaped by absence and uncertainty. The opening line, “no light had been seen,” establishes both literal darkness and a figurative lack of clarity—something (or someone) has been hidden from view, and the speaker is left without reassurance. The second line, “wrapt only in a green rug,” narrows the focus to a single vivid image: a body-like form bundled in something ordinary and domestic. The choice of “green” can suggest life, nature, or healing, yet here it feels ambiguous—comforting like a blanket, but also concealing like a shroud. The final line, “whether sick or sound,” lands as a hushed question, revealing the speaker’s doubt and concern. The poem’s power lies in what it withholds: we are given no explanation, only the tension between care and fear, rest and danger. In three lines, it captures how darkness breeds anxiety, and how a simple covering can become a symbol of vulnerability and unknown fate.

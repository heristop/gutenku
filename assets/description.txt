This haiku presents a serene yet whimsical scene, juxtaposing the calmness of a race with the mundane act of taking up biscuits. The first line, 'Which to attend to,' sets up a choice or a moment of indecision. The second line, 'A beautifully calm race,' introduces an unexpected image of a race that is not frantic but peaceful, perhaps metaphorical for life's journey or a moment of contemplation. The final line, 'Taking up biscuits,' adds a touch of everyday simplicity, grounding the haiku in a relatable, almost humorous reality. The haiku captures the essence of finding beauty and calm in the ordinary, and the gentle conflict between action and stillness.

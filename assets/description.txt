This haiku captures the essence of finding peace through certainty. The first line, 'There is to be had,' suggests that something valuable is attainable. The second line, 'In an assured kind of way,' implies that this attainment comes with a sense of confidence and security. Finally, 'Then a great quiet' signifies the profound tranquility that follows once this assured state is reached. The poem beautifully encapsulates the journey from seeking to finding, and ultimately, to the serene silence that accompanies fulfillment.

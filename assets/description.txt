This haiku captures a moment of striking transition in nature. It opens with “The silent ocean,” establishing a mood of stillness and restraint, as if the sea is holding its breath. The second line—“The sun rose red and fiery”—introduces vivid colour and heat, suggesting both beauty and a hint of warning; the redness can imply intensity, danger, or an impending change in weather. The final line, “With a rising gale,” shifts the scene from calm to movement, revealing that the quiet was temporary and that powerful forces are gathering. Overall, the poem contrasts silence with sudden energy, using concise imagery to show how quickly the natural world can turn from serene to turbulent.

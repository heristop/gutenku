This haiku presents a bleak, gothic moment where life seems to hover on the edge of extinction. The opening image, “languishing in death,” suggests prolonged suffering rather than a swift end—an existence trapped in decay or grief. The second line, “It was a very dark night,” widens the scene into a classic setting of fear and uncertainty, using darkness as both literal absence of light and a metaphor for emotional despair. The final line, “with a feeble voice,” introduces a fragile trace of humanity: a whisper of resistance, a last confession, or a fading plea. Taken together, the poem contrasts vast darkness with a small, weakening sound, emphasizing how vulnerability persists even at the brink of silence.

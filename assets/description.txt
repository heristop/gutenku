This haiku captures a fleeting moment of interaction between a person and a buzzing insect, likely a bee. The first line, 'Seeming lost in thought,' sets a contemplative tone, suggesting that the observer is deep in their own musings. The second line, 'It first buzzed over my head,' introduces the bee, whose sudden presence disrupts the observer's thoughts. The final line, 'All at once she flushed,' conveys a swift and intense reaction, possibly of surprise or fear, as the observer becomes acutely aware of the bee. The haiku beautifully encapsulates the transient nature of such encounters and the sudden shift from introspection to immediate awareness.

This haiku captures a mind caught in the quiet loop of reflection. “still considering” opens on a moment of lingering thought—an unfinished mental action that suggests hesitation, regret, or longing. The second line, “The recollection of them,” introduces an absent presence: “them” could be people, moments, or versions of the self, made vivid only through memory. In the final line, “all this is nothing,” the speaker abruptly judges the entire process—thoughts, memories, and emotional weight—as empty or futile. The power of the poem lies in its stark turn: remembrance builds expectation, but it collapses into a bleak recognition of impermanence. The simplicity of the language mirrors the stripping away of meaning, leaving the reader in a spare, meditative silence.

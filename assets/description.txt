This haiku traces a widening lens: it begins with the grounded solidity of “Mountains,” then moves outward to the open expanse of “the sea,” suggesting a journey from stability to vastness. The middle line—“Person in the universe”—places a single human figure against this immense backdrop, emphasizing both smallness and belonging, as if the self is briefly measured against creation. The final line, “The sun from rising,” introduces a moment of renewal: dawn becomes a quiet assurance that cycles continue beyond individual concerns. Overall, the poem balances scale and simplicity—earth, ocean, human, cosmos, and sunrise—inviting reflection on humility, connection, and the fresh perspective that comes with a new day.

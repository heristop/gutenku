This haiku captures a moment of early morning ambiguity. The speaker awakens to a dawn that is not yet fully formed, shrouded in indistinct light. This uncertainty leads them to question their own perception, highlighting the transient and often deceptive nature of early morning light. The poem beautifully encapsulates the fleeting, almost dreamlike quality of dawn, where reality and illusion blur together.

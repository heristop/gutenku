This haiku turns on the quiet hinge of the opening phrase, “on the other hand,” which suggests both a shift in argument and the literal image of a hand holding records. The speaker seems to be weighing evidence, “reviewing his cases,” in a calm, methodical act that feels legal or medical—someone trained to sift details rather than react emotionally. The final line, “which come from this source,” narrows the focus to origins: the cases are not random but traceable, implying causation and responsibility. In typical haiku fashion, the poem captures a single, concentrated moment of scrutiny—an almost clinical pause where attention moves from surface facts to where they begin, inviting us to consider how outcomes are shaped by their sources.

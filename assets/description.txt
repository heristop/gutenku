This haiku captures a fleeting moment of nature's unpredictability and beauty. The first line, 'Luckily for me,' sets a tone of gratitude and relief, suggesting that the speaker narrowly avoided an unpleasant experience. The second line, 'It first buzzed over my head,' introduces an element of surprise and tension, as the buzzing could imply an insect or some other small creature. The final line, 'All at once she flushed,' reveals the sudden appearance of a bird or perhaps a small animal, flushed out of hiding. The haiku masterfully conveys a brief yet vivid scene, emphasizing the unexpected and transient nature of such encounters.

This haiku captures a fleeting moment of connection and the subsequent shift in perception. The speaker's eye moves away from someone's face, suggesting a moment of separation or reflection. As their gaze shifts, the 'radiance increasing' implies a growing awareness or appreciation of the surrounding beauty, perhaps the warmth and brightness of the day itself. The mention of the 'day being warm' adds a sensory layer, evoking a sense of comfort and tranquility. This haiku beautifully encapsulates how a brief encounter can enhance one's perception of the world, highlighting the interplay between human connection and nature's splendor.

This haiku captures a moment of introspection and guidance. 'Apollo guides me' suggests the influence of the Greek god of light, music, and prophecy, symbolizing enlightenment and direction. The second line, 'There needs must be a limit,' introduces the idea of boundaries and the necessity of recognizing one's limitations. The final line, 'Through glass Reflected,' evokes the image of self-reflection and introspection, as glass often symbolizes clarity and truth. Together, the haiku explores the balance between seeking guidance and understanding one's own limits, all while reflecting on one's inner self.

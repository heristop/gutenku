This haiku captures a moment of youthful spontaneity and the beauty of a new day. The first line, 'He ran up to her,' suggests a sense of urgency or excitement, perhaps indicating a meeting or reunion. The second line, 'The sun had fully risen,' sets the scene in the early morning, symbolizing new beginnings and the promise of a fresh start. The final line, 'In sight of the boy,' implies that this moment is being observed by a young onlooker, adding a layer of innocence and wonder to the scene. The haiku effectively uses the natural imagery of the rising sun to mirror the emotions of the characters, creating a vivid and evocative snapshot of a fleeting moment.

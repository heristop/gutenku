This haiku captures a moment of anticipation and arrival, set against the backdrop of late October. The phrase 'Make haste and come in' suggests urgency and a welcoming invitation, perhaps to escape the chill of autumn or to embrace a long-awaited reunion. The mention of 'late in October' evokes a sense of transition, as the season moves towards winter, symbolizing change and the passage of time. The arrival of the boat signifies the culmination of a journey, bringing with it new beginnings or the fulfillment of expectations. The haiku beautifully encapsulates the themes of anticipation, change, and the cyclical nature of time.

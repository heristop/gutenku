This haiku juxtaposes radiance, longing, and abrupt sound to trace a swift emotional turn. “The golden marvel” evokes something luminous and cherished—perhaps autumn light, a beloved presence, or a moment that feels rare and precious. The archaic diction in “longeth thy smiling for tears” personifies that marvel as yearning: it desires the transformation of a smile into tears, suggesting beauty that carries sorrow beneath it, or joy so intense it presses toward weeping. The final line, “the spontaneous bark,” snaps the poem into the immediate world with a sharp, unplanned interruption—likely a dog’s bark, though it can also read as the bark of a tree, roughened and sudden in texture. Either way, it acts as a sonic jolt that breaks reverie, turning private emotion outward. Overall, the poem captures how quickly wonder can tip into melancholy, and how an ordinary, unexpected sound can puncture a delicate, golden moment.

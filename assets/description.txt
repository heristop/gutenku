This haiku captures a moment of quiet observation and introspection. The first line, 'Glancing quickly round,' suggests a fleeting, perhaps cautious, look at one's surroundings. The second line, 'The smoke still curled upward,' evokes a sense of continuity and calm, as smoke rising is a gentle, unhurried action. The final line, 'He gives no trouble,' implies a peaceful presence, someone who exists without causing disturbance. Together, these lines create a serene image of someone who is mindful and unobtrusive, blending seamlessly into their environment.

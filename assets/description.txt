This haiku captures a poignant moment of vulnerability and care. The first line, 'To watch over him,' suggests a protective presence, perhaps a parent or guardian, observing a child. The imagery of 'His rosy mouth half open' evokes innocence and peacefulness, as if the child is asleep or in a state of serene rest. The final line, 'If I must be sold,' introduces a jarring contrast, hinting at sacrifice or hardship faced by the observer. This line suggests a willingness to endure personal loss for the sake of the child's well-being, highlighting themes of love, duty, and selflessness.

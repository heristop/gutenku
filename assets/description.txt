This haiku presents a vivid image of cosmic romance, where the sun, personified as a 'light-surrounded being,' becomes a symbol of love and admiration. The phrase 'Is all solar love' suggests a contemplation of the sun's role as a universal source of warmth and affection. The final line, 'The prince proposeth,' introduces a regal figure, perhaps symbolizing humanity or a celestial entity, who is captivated by the sun's radiant allure. This haiku beautifully captures the interplay between nature and human emotion, inviting readers to ponder the grandeur of love and its cosmic connections.

This haiku captures the essence of anticipation and the peace that follows fulfillment. The first line, 'There is to be had,' suggests the presence of something attainable, something within reach. It speaks to the potential and promise of what is to come. The second line, 'In an assured kind of way,' conveys a sense of confidence and certainty, as if the speaker is convinced of the inevitability of this attainment. Finally, 'Then a great quiet' reflects the profound silence and tranquility that ensues once the anticipated event or state is realized. This haiku beautifully encapsulates the journey from expectation to fulfillment, and the serene calm that follows.

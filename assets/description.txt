This haiku captures a moment of pure childhood innocence and freedom. The 'large brown eyes' suggest a sense of wonder and curiosity, while the 'blanket over her' evokes a feeling of comfort and security. The imagery of a 'free and happy child' encapsulates the essence of unburdened joy and the simple pleasures found in the safety of one's own world. The poem invites readers to reminisce about their own childhoods and the unadulterated happiness that comes with it.

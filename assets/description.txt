This haiku captures the serene and mystical allure of sleep, personifying it as a 'golden marvel.' The poem begins by emphasizing the significance of those moments or individuals for whom sleep is a cherished visitor. The phrase 'especially those' suggests a selectiveness, perhaps hinting at the idea that not everyone is graced with such peaceful slumber. The middle line, 'That sleep may come unto him,' evokes a sense of longing or anticipation, as if sleep is a gentle, awaited guest. The final line, 'The golden marvel,' paints sleep as something precious and awe-inspiring, elevating it to a status of wonder and beauty. The haiku, with its concise yet evocative imagery, invites readers to reflect on the tranquility and mystery of sleep, and the specialness of those who experience it fully.

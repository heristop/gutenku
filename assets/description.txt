This haiku captures a moment of universal appreciation and joy. The speaker observes a collective enjoyment, suggesting that 'they'—perhaps people, animals, or even nature itself—find something delightful. The phrase 'the whole big dear world' evokes a sense of inclusivity and affection, as if the entire world is united in this shared experience of pleasure. The haiku's simplicity and warmth invite readers to reflect on the small yet profound joys that connect us all.

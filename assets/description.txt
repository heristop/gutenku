This haiku captures a fleeting moment of interaction with nature, specifically a dragonfly. The first line, 'Seeming lost in thought,' personifies the dragonfly, attributing it with a contemplative state, which draws the reader into a shared moment of stillness. The second line, 'It first buzzed over my head,' introduces movement and a sense of surprise, as the dragonfly's presence is suddenly felt. The final line, 'All at once she flushed,' suggests a rapid departure, perhaps startled by the observer's presence. The use of 'she' adds a layer of intimacy and personification, making the dragonfly's exit feel almost like a shy retreat. This haiku beautifully encapsulates the transient and delicate nature of such encounters, leaving a lingering impression of both wonder and fleeting beauty.

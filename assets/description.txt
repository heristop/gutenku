This haiku captures the ethereal and transient nature of dawn, a time when the world is caught between night and day. The repetition of 'As it seemed to me' bookends the poem, emphasizing the subjective and personal experience of witnessing the break of day. The phrase 'the dawn was still indistinct' suggests a moment of uncertainty and ambiguity, where the light is just beginning to emerge, yet remains undefined. This haiku invites readers to reflect on the beauty of fleeting moments and the personal perceptions that shape our experiences of the natural world.

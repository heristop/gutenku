This haiku captures the profound solitude and introspection that often accompany the act of falling asleep. The first line, 'Especially those,' suggests a focus on individuals who are perhaps more sensitive or introspective. The second line, 'That sleep may come unto him,' implies a longing or need for rest, hinting at the vulnerability and surrender involved in sleep. The final line, 'All things separate,' evokes the idea of detachment from the waking world, where the boundaries between self and surroundings dissolve, leaving one in a state of peaceful isolation. This haiku beautifully encapsulates the transition from wakefulness to the dream world, where all external distractions fade away, leaving only the essence of the self.

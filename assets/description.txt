This haiku imagines the sky as a dialogue between opposites: moon and sun. The first line sets up a quiet transition—night yielding to day—suggesting a handover of power. In the second line, “stirring up the deep waters” evokes tidal pull and emotional undercurrents, as if celestial movement reaches into the earth’s most hidden places. The final line, “making the clouds fall,” personifies weather as a consequence of this cosmic influence: clouds become heavy, descending like rain or like a curtain dropping at the end of a scene. Overall, the poem compresses a vast natural cycle into three swift images, blending astronomy, ocean, and atmosphere to suggest that even distant forces can unsettle what seems stable.

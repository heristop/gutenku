This haiku captures a poignant moment of emotional turbulence and the contrasting clarity that can be found in nature. The first line, 'When she again lived,' suggests a return to a familiar state of being, possibly one of suffering or introspection. The 'painful state of mind' in the second line deepens this sense of internal struggle. However, the final line, 'Your summits are clear,' introduces a powerful juxtaposition. The clear summits symbolize purity, perspective, and perhaps hope, standing in stark contrast to the turmoil within. This haiku beautifully illustrates how nature's steadfastness can offer solace and clarity even in our darkest moments.

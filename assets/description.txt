This haiku moves outward in widening circles: from “Mountains” to “the sea,” then to a single “Person” set against the vastness of “the universe.” The first line contrasts solidity and depth—enduring mountains followed by the open, shifting sea—suggesting the full range of nature’s scale and mood. The second line places a human figure within that immensity, not as a conqueror but as a small, reflective presence, inviting humility and wonder. The final line, “The sun from rising,” introduces a moment of beginning: dawn as renewal, clarity, and perspective. Read together, the poem frames an awakening—standing between land and water, the speaker senses their place in a larger cosmos as the day (and perhaps understanding) starts to unfold.

This haiku evokes a deep connection between human experience and the natural world, illustrating how the lines of a person's face can mirror the timelessness of mountain lakes. The opening line suggests a contemplative approach to understanding a person, akin to the way one observes the serene surface of a lake. The imagery of 'tideless mountain lakes' conveys a sense of tranquility and permanence, suggesting that, like these lakes, the essence of a person can be both calm and enduring. The juxtaposition of human features with the natural landscape invites readers to reflect on the passage of time and the beauty found in both nature and human life.

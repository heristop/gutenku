This haiku captures the poignant essence of unrequited love and selflessness. The first line, 'Nobody loved him,' sets a somber tone, highlighting the isolation and longing of the subject. The second line, 'He hoped she would be happy,' reveals a deep, altruistic affection, where the subject's primary concern is the happiness of the beloved, even if it means his own feelings remain unreciprocated. The final line, 'Filled with contentment,' suggests a resolution, where the subject finds peace and fulfillment in the act of loving selflessly, despite the absence of mutual affection. This haiku beautifully encapsulates the bittersweet nature of love that asks for nothing in return.

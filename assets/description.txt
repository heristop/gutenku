This haiku explores the duality of desire and its unintended consequences. The 'celestial love' suggests a pure, divine affection that aims to fulfill every wish. However, the twist lies in the final line, where these fulfilled desires lead to 'corruption.' This reflects the idea that unchecked desires, even when granted by a benevolent force, can lead to moral decay or unintended negative outcomes. The haiku serves as a cautionary reflection on the nature of human desires and the potential pitfalls of having them all met without restraint.

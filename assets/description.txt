This haiku captures a fleeting moment of observation and reflection. The speaker notices a group of people approaching, and the initial impression is one of pleasantness and contentment. The phrase 'Very pleasant was their day' suggests a harmonious and joyful experience shared by these individuals. The concluding line, 'However perfect,' introduces a subtle twist, hinting at the ephemeral nature of perfection. It suggests that while the moment may seem flawless, it is transient, much like the passing of the people themselves. This haiku invites readers to appreciate the beauty in brief, perfect moments, even as they acknowledge their impermanence.

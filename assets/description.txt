This haiku captures a moment of profound connection and love between two individuals. The first line, 'We were together,' sets the scene of unity and companionship. The second line, 'With great affection of love,' emphasizes the depth of their emotional bond, suggesting a love that is both tender and powerful. The final line, 'Robing day in light,' uses metaphorical language to convey how their love transforms and brightens their surroundings, as if their affection is so radiant that it cloaks the day in light. This haiku beautifully encapsulates the idea that love has the power to illuminate and enhance the world around us.

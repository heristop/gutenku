This haiku delves into the universal human desire for restful sleep, juxtaposed with the challenge of impatience. The first line, 'Can the good be true,' sets a contemplative tone, questioning the possibility of achieving something positive. The second line, 'That sleep may come unto him,' introduces the specific 'good' being sought: the blessing of sleep. The final line, 'No impatient one,' reveals the obstacle to this desireâ€”impatience. The haiku suggests that tranquility and rest are attainable only when one can overcome impatience, hinting at a deeper philosophical reflection on the virtues of patience and calmness in achieving inner peace.

## 🎮 What is GutenGuess?

**GutenGuess** is a daily literary puzzle inspired by Wordle. One guess per day, same challenge for everyone.

Your mission: **identify which classic book hides behind today's verses.**

It's the ultimate test — can you recognize literature from poetic fragments?

## 🎯 How to Play

1. **Start with clues**: You begin with 2 emoticons and 1 haiku from the mystery book
2. **Make your guess**: Search through 600+ classic books to find the right one
3. **Wrong guess?** A new hint unlocks (genre, era, author, quote...)
4. **6 attempts** to identify the book — can you get it on the first try?

The fewer hints you use, the higher your score!

## 🏆 The Challenge

Each day, verses are extracted from a single classic book. The words are authentic, pulled directly from Shakespeare, Austen, Dickens, and other public domain works. Combined with emoticons that capture the book's essence, you have all the clues you need.

Can you recognize the source?
